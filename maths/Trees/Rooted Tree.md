# Definition
A type of [[Tree]] where all nodes have a common parent, the root [[Tree#Nodes|node]] ($r$), which itself has no parent. 

# Recursive definition
Can be defined recursively:
- An empty tree (the identity element)
- A filled tree: a root node $r$ whose left and right sub-trees are also rooted trees

# Height
- The height of a rooted tree is the longest path from the root node to another node
