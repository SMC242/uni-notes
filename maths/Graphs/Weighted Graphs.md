# Overview
A type of graph where each edge has a value assigned to it. This is called the "weight" of the edge. If an edge is not connected to a component, its weight is $\infty$

# Use cases
- Finding a path with the lowest cost/distance/time 

# Adjacency matrix
Known as the weight matrix

# Adjacency list
The weight is included in each node
