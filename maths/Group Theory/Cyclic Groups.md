# Overview
A [[Group]] that wraps around to the first element. They can be infinite, but this note will focus on finite cyclic groups

# Notation
- $G$ or $\langle g \rangle$ is a finite [[Maths Map#Set theory|set]] of $q$ elements
	- $G = \{1 = g^{0}, g = g^{1}, g^{2}, \dots, g^{q-1}\}$
- The base element $g$ is also known as the "generator of $G$"
- Elements of $G$ are generated by repeatedly applying some operation
	- Referred to as *"A cyclic group generated by $g$ under {operation name}*
- The $q$th step returns to the first element

# Arithmetic
Assuming that the operation is multiplication:
- Multiplication: $g^{x} \cdot g^{y} = g^{(x+y) \mod q}$
- Division: $\frac{g^{x}}{g^{y}} = g^{(x-y) \mod q}$
- Exponentiation: $(g^{x})^{y} = g^{(x \cdot y) \mod q}$
