# Overview
A very common operator in programming languages. It outputs the remainder of a [[Division]]

# Definition
$\textrm{a mod m} = r$ such that $a = q \times m$

See also: [[Division#Algorithm|where that formula comes from]]

# Congruence
Congruence is when some divisor $m$ divides $a - b$

Written as $a \equiv b (\textrm{mod m})$

## Properties
- $\textrm{a mod m} = \textrm{b mod m}$
- If $m$ divides $a - b$, it also divides $b - a$ and $-(a - b)$
