# Overview
- Summations are a compact way of mapping some function to a sequence and summing the results
	- Essentially `sum $ map f`
- They specify the start, stop, and how to calculate each element of the sequence

# Notation
$$\sum\limits_{start}^{end} element = formula$$

# Examples
$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} i = n \times (n + 1) / 2$
This is the formula for the area of a triangle within a rectangle

# Products
You can do the same with multiplication with this notation:
$$output = \prod\limits_{start}^{end}\textrm{Some function}$$
