# Definition
A number is prime if:
- $p > 1$
- The only _positive_ factors are 1 and itself, $p$

A number that fails this condition, it is called a _composite number_

# Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
Every positive integer > 1 is the unique product of some prime numbers
$$n = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_{i}}= p_{1} \cdots p_{1}\times p_{2} \cdots p_{2} \cdots p_{k}\cdots p_k$$
Note that $\cdots$ represents many multiplications via $\times$
