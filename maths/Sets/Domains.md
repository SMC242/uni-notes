# Overview
- A domain is a a set with some constraints

# Number sets
All of these sets are [[Infinity#Counting|countably infinite]]. Each of them is larger than the last
- $\mathbb{N}$:  natural numbers $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$: integers $\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$: rationals (finite decimal numbers)
- $\mathbb{R}$: reals ($\mathbb{Q}$ and irrational numbers like $\pi$)
- $\mathbb{I}$: imaginary numbers ($\sqrt{-1}$ AKA $i$)
- $\mathbb{C}$: complex numbers (imaginary numbers with a real component like $1+3i$)
