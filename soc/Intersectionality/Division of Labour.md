# Reproductive labour
- Migrant labour is imported to fill reproductive labour roles
	- This reinforces racial divides (immigrants work the low-paid service jobs)
	- It also reinforces gender divides because women usually do these roles
- When [[Neoliberalism]] came in, women were now expected to work while also doing reproductive labour
	- Women are segregated into certain jobs, usually involving caring for others
	- This meant that middle class women needed more support with reproductive labour --> employing migrant workers to do it
- As the population becomes older, more and more care workers are needed
	- These workers are paid with pensions (from the government)
	- This means that the government indirectly pays for this
- Since these workers are working for many individual families rather than an organisation, it is difficult for them to unionise

## Buying out of inequality
- Using migrants to do the reproductive labour is essentially middle class women to exchanging money for more equal division of labour within their family
	- This is as much relief as it is a show of status
- This leads to women from the Global South moving to Global North countries ("care drain")
	- Unequal distribution of care across the world
	- Leaves motherless families in the Global South (the mother becomes a transnational breadwinner)
- The women left behind in the Global South now have to fill in for those who left

Thesis: **Care is a global resource that the Global North drains from the South**

# Job stratification
- Migrant women tend to do domestic labour
- Migrant men tend to do jobs outside the home
	- Gardening
	- Painting
	- Washing cars
- Men tend to deal with customers
	- Women end up being room cleaners
		- More likely to work informally too
	- Men handle sales or using computers

## 3-way relationship
- White men do the "professional" and managerial work
- White women mediate between white male superiors and racial-ethnic subordinates
	- Clerical jobs such as secretaries

See Evelyn Nakano Glenn 1992

# Employment
- Racialised women work longer hours
- They are more likely to be unemployed
- Migrant women are over-represented in 3D jobs
	- "Dirty, dangerous, and demanding" - usually temporary or part-time
	- Private agencies manage them, instead of being directly employed by their site of work
	- Makes it difficult to unionise because workers are often shifted between sites

# Immigration policies
- Politicians and employers say that migrant women are well-suited to these kinds of labour (naturalisation)
