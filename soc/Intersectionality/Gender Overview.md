# Functionalism
- Naturalised the notion of sex roles
- They thought that the reason women end up doing most of the domestic and reproductive labour is because they are just better at it
- Similarly, they figured that men end up working because they're better at it

See [[Functionalism]]

# Sex/gender distinction
- Sex and gender was first separated in Oakley 1974 and Scott 1984
- They viewed gender roles as created through gendered socialisation
	- Girls are taught to dress well, cook, and clean
	- Boys are told to be strong and fearless
	- Boys and girls are also exposed to different hobbies
- Bradley 2013 argued that gender was created in order to make sense of the world - it's a way to categorise people to make understanding things simpler
- Gender changes depending on the social context

# Spatial gender
- Women do most reproductive labour
	- This is unpaid and undervalued
- Men do most of the physical labour and occupy more high-ranking positions in society
- Roles that are associated with masculinity are more prestigious than their feminine counterparts
	- Nurse vs doctor
	- Teacher vs headmaster
	- Home cook or dinner lady vs chef
- Men tend to view their role in a family as supporting their family financially rather than nurturing
	- The number of hours that men work increases when they have children
	- They will seek promotions in order to provide more for the family
	- This leads to neglect from father figures

# Vertical gender segregation
- Women tend to occupy lower-ranking positions
	- They are less likely to be promoted
- Additionally, they occupy more low-paid positions
- This is often justified as employers not wanting to pay for maternity leave or women *just not focusing enough on their careers*
	- Unlikely to be true

# Constructing the patriarchy
- Women are portrayed as weak, illogical, and inferior to men
- Masculinity is constructed in opposition to feminimity
	- This is why emasculating a man is the worst thing that can happen to them 
	- Men engage in many behaviours to reinforce their masculinity
	- [[Sigmund Freud]] scratched the surface of this topic with "castration anxiety", but his theories are very patriarchal and should not be used
