# White feminism
- Ethnocentric due to ignoring the intersections of ethnicity and gender
- Fails to see the unique issues that come when someone is say, a black woman
- It also assumes that experiences of white women are universal
	- Both within the Global North and between the Global North and South
- White women tend to live in nuclear families since the 1950s

# Black experiences
- The family is a place of solidarity from the racism that surrounds them
- Tend to live in extended families
- Painted as welfare scroungers
- Discriminated against due to perception of lots of children
	- White fears of being outnumbered

# Fractured feminism
- As mainstream feminism didn't account for black experiences, black women felt that they had to choose between anti-racist movements and white feminist movements
- Neither group of movements focused on black women - only one half of their identity
