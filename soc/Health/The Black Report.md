# Overview
- A report from the 1980s posing theories about health inequalities
- Debunked lots of theories that attempted to explain the link between socioeconomic status and health

# Artefact
- The theory states that there's no significant relationship between socioeconomic position and health outcomes
- Widely debunked

# Selection
- It was posed that poor health causes your social status to decline
	- "Reverse causation argument" - an inversion of "low status causes poor health"
- You may lose your job and have to take a worse one
	- May be more dangerous, pay less, and have less benefits
- Longitudinal studies have shown that socioeconomic position does affect health
- This "social sliding" has been debunked via studies of alcoholism

## IQ
- Some researchers have looked for a link between IQ and socioeconomic status and therefore health
	- The idea is that your genes define these outcomes
- Smarter = better health
	- Implies that poorer people aren't as smart
- The Flynn Effect shows that IQ changes over time with education
- The IQ test doesn't produce stable results over time (unreliable test)

# Behaviour/culture
Behaviours such as:
- Alcoholism
- Diet
- Smoking

Culture such as:
- Worklessness
- Not seeking education

- The idea is that poorer people make worse decisions
- Unhealthy behaviours occur more in lower status groups
- However, when people from low and high status do the same behaviours, health outcomes still differ
- You may inherit your behaviours from people around you --> it's a result of socioeconomic status
