# Formal definition
- When someone has a BMI of>30
- This is hard to apply to children because their weight and height changes rapidly

# Is it an illness?
- Some people view it as an illness
- Some people may be predisposed to it (their phenotype)
- Risk factors such as having access to poor quality food increase the likelihood of an individual being obese

# Trend over time
- The BMI distribution has shifted towards obesity over time
- The distribution has also flattened
- The least deprived people have the highest rates of obesity
	- This is also true at the country level

# Social effects of obesity
- People may be shamed for being fat
	- This has changed over time
	- In the medieval period, being fat was a sign of wealth as they had access to lots of food and didn't have to do much labour
	- Now, access to high quality food is a sign of wealth
- Difficulty joining in on certain acitvities
	- Weight restrictions on theme park rides
	- Difficulty doing sports

# Economic costs
- Treating the associated illnesses
- Installing infrastructure to support obese people (E.G lifts and ramps)

# Causes
Genetics >
individual choices >
family and community (what you've been brought up to enjoy eating) >
national (car-based infrastructure vs walkable cities) >
international (food prices)

# Obesogenic environment
- Readily available, cheap, and advertised foods that have high calories
- Weirdly, the calorific intake has decreased
	- People were doing more manual labour, which balanced out the higher intake
- We're less active now due to technologies saving labour
	- Washing machines
	- Lifts
	- Remote controls
	- Transport (cars, public transport)
- Less people do manual labour

# Bourdieu
Drawing on [[Pierre Bourdieu]]:
- If you grew up in a family in rural France, you would be used to large family meals and have little access to fast food
- This [[Pierre Bourdieu#Habitus|habitus]] would lead to a healthier diet compared to someone who has high access to fast food and is used to grazing instead of distinct meals
- Inheriting lessons like "eat everything on your plate or starve" may lead to eating when not hungry
	- An example of [[Pierre Bourdieu#cultural capital|cultural capital]]
- We've been taught to snack while watching TV ("colonisation") and TVs advertise things to eat ("insemination")

# Marx-Weber
Drawing on [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]]:
- Companies advertise foods and profit greatly from marketing food you don't need
- They also benefit from shaming you for being fat and selling you diets/healthy foods/workout programmes
- The mechanisation of work has lead to more sedentary lifestyles
- Tobacco is very profitable and has been strongly marketed despite a wealth of evidence of its risks
	- Profits are more important than well-being under capitalism
	- Tobacco companies lobbied to prevent restrictions on advertisements to children and warnings on their packages
