# Structural and political economy
- Income, wealth, and power (class) have the largest impacts
- Health improves when people are given more resources
- The richest people are usually healthier

- Information campaigns (advertising) are ineffective
- Food labelling doesn't help poorer people because they can't afford high quality food
- School-based campaigns like anti-alcohol programmes don't work because they fail to target groups specifically

## Effective

- Structural changes 
	- No smoking outside
	- Placing a max salt content on all foods

# Marxist perspectives
Drawing from [[Karl Marx]]'s writing:
- Workers have less agency
- Bosses benefit from their labour
- It's in the rich's interests to blame inequalities on individuals instead of redistributing wealth

Drawing from [[Max Weber]]:
- Being injured makes you less likely to get a job (perceived as unfit to work)
- People who are working long hours have less time to pursue education
- Poorer people have less time and resources to look presentable

Drawing from [[Pierre Bourdieu]]:
- Your family passes down social capital that makes you more appealing to an employer
- Markers of social capital allow groups to cement their barriers, preventing social mobility and therefore mobility into better health outcomes
