# Political economists
- Academics that contextualise economics in a broader political context
- Academics such as Adam Smith, [[Karl Marx]], and Ricardo
- A lot of theorists have removed health inequalities from the context
	- Financial crash of 2008
	- Neoliberalism cutting social supports

# Recession
- The corpus overall shows that self-rated health and metal health worsen under recession
	- Young men's mortality goes down due to lesser access to fast cars and drugs
- It's hard to study this topic because most studies look at the effects of austerity
	- A lot of governments will also use Keynesian methods to revive their economies
	- They do this by creating money and using it to inject money into the economy

# Income inequality
- It's hard to say how this affects health outcomes, but it does negatively affect them
- It could affect via psycho-social stress or access to resources

# Welfare states
- Life expectancy in Russia dropped by 8 years when it was neoliberalised
- This meant cutting government funding for social services in favour of supporting private enterprises

# Income
- Giving people money during a drought reduces infant mortality by 74%
- Job insecurity due to privatisation worsens mental health
- Mortality rates are reduced by 67% when someone gets employed
	- However, the quality of the work may negate this gain

# Child-focused
- Microfinance to mothers improves infant and maternal mortality
	- Microfinance is the idea of lending small amounts of money, typically to mothers, in order to enable medium-sized purchases like sewing and washing machines
- Compulsory education reduces mortality

# Growth
- Economic growth isn't always good
- You can do a bad thing that ends up employing more people

## Examples
- Creating nuclear waste creates the need for people to clean it up
- Building factories creates lots of new jobs, but increases pollution which will eventually cause economic collapse
