# Bad measures
- Mortality
	- Too narrow
	- A bedridden person is still alive, yet they are unwell

# Subjective measures
- Self-rated health is subjective
	- Culturally contextualised (comparing to family members)
	- People may try to be brave or ham up minor illnesses

# Objective measures
- Measures that come from outwith an individual
- Often fine-grained such as diagnoses of depression, [[Obesity|BMI]], or rates of smoking
