# What is it?
- The study of human societies
- How they differ
- How they're similar
- This reveals that some things are not natural
	- E.G gender is defined differently between societies
- Understanding a native's point of view ("insider perspective")
	- Take them seriously

# Methods
- Strong emphasis on fieldwork
- Participant observation
	- Take part in their society for a while
- Working closely with interpreters
- Translation
- #Ethnography (written account of what the researcher saw)
- Fundamentally comparative as a field
	- Doesn't just study one society
	- Study multiple and compare them

# Fieldwork
- Should be long-term (1 year +)
	- To see the agricultural systems 
	- To be fully integrated into society

# Colonial roots
- Came from Western imperialist
- Made possible by colonialism
	- Gave researchers access to those dominated societies
- This may have corrupted the kinds of questions anthropologists ask
- The involvement with colonialism varies between researchers
- There has been a recent effort to decolonise the field, but the roots may still affect it

# Relationship with Sociology
- Combines "from the inside" methods like ethnography and "from the outside" methods like theory
- Useful for critiquing Western assumptions about society
	- Experiences are not necessarily universal
	- Any theory must be grounded in its societal context

# Taking others seriously
- "How should we live?" is a question that has been asked in each and every society
- It doesn't have an obvious answer, nor a correct one
- Anthropology is about learning from others
	- The people that the researcher is living with are viewed as teachers, not participants or informants in studies
