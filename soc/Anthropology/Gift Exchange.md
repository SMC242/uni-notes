# Types of exchange
## Commodity
- Money is exchanged for goods
- The commodity has [[Value#Use value|use value]] (food is tasty, tools are helpful)
- It also has [[Value#Exchange value|exchange value]]: it can be traded for something perceived to be of equal value
- Two ways of representing exchange value: price ("monetary value") and bartering (trading)

## Gift
- A gift is when something is given without immediately receiving something of equal value

# Reciprocation
- When we are given a gift, we feel obligated to give one back
- Reciprocation isn't necessarily equal or immediate
	- A gift of a book might be met with a pair of shoes a year later
- Gifts aren't necessarily tangible
	- A hug could be a gift
	- Letting someone stay over for a night is a gift

# Relationships
- Relationships are given concrete form via gifts
	- It's a visible representation of a relationship
- Important for gluing people together

# Obligations
There are 3 moral obligations associated with gifts:
- Giving
- Receiving / accepting
- Reciprocating

Due to this, gifts aren't accumulated, but circulated

# Potlatches
- A ceremony in Tlingit, Kwakiutl, and Haida societies
- In this ceremoney, people give gifts to signal prestige
- Almost like a tax
- Very competitive - even violent
	- People may destroy gifts to show that they have so much that they don't need it
- Refusing to participate is like declaring war
	- It is a refusal to enter a social relationship
	- Giving gifts reduces conflict by binding them into a social contract

# Maori traditions
- They believe that part of your spirit remains in a gift
- It's like giving part of yourself to someone
- If you don't return a gift, they believe that something horrible will happen to them

# The Kula Ring
- Occurs in an archipelago
- Gifts circulate between the islands
- Armbands go one way
- Necklaces go another
- People cross a large distance to give these gifts
- The gift gets given to the villagers by the chief (redistribution)
- Also allows an opportunity for trade

# Peace
- Ceremonial gifting helps to allow trade because they can't trade if they're currently fighting
- This knowledge was used to criticise European countries following WW1
	- "nations will have to learn how to confront each other without massacring each other"

# Capitalism
- Capitalist exchange is very shallow
- After monetary exchange, the relationship is ended
- It would be more sustainable to create relationships with the people we buy things from
