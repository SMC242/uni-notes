# What is it?
- It is not culture, but a series of boundaries that form ethnic groups and identities
- Ethnic identities are relational, meaning that they are formed in opposition to each other
	- Social boundaries create in-groups and out-groups and many behaviours within and between groups serve to reproduce this (E.G [[Pierre Bourdieu|social capital]])

# Forming boundaries
## Example
- Muslims were painted as terrorists, rapists, and violent during the Syrian refugee crisis
- They were also portrayed as backwards and this has been used to [[Homonationalism|justify wars]]

# Racialisation
- Relies on naturalised notions of ethnic differences
	- Some races are portrayed as being better at certain things
	- Or having different temperaments (E.G violent, hard working, good at maths)
	- This is verbalised as differing genes or different cultures
		- There is very little genetic difference between races
- This concept of race has been used to justify [[Colonialism]]
	- Africans and Native Americans were dehumanised and portrayed as less intelligent and primitive
- Racialisation is the process of assigning significance to perceived differences between groups
	- It is used to justify racial hierarchies

# Division of labour
- Racialised peoples have historically and are currently forced into low or unpaid labour (slavery)
	- Servants
	- Labourers
	- Cleaners
	- Taxi drivers
	- Shop keepers (particularly night shifts)
- This has created an environment where these peoples have been denied the generational wealth that white people - who have exploited other groups - have
	- This leads to poor access to resources such as healthcare, quality food, and education
- The [[Prison-industrial complex|police and media]] are key tools for reinforcing this hierarchy

# Identity
Bradley et al. 2003 asked black women whether they identified more as a black person or a woman
- In places where there was lots of sexism, respondents usually said they identified more as a woman
- Where women had been successfully integrated into the workforce, they identified more as black person

This shows that what you are othered for defined your identity

# Race
- Sociologists are moving away from the term due to its strong relationship with [[Colonialism]]
