# Importance of order
- Order gives inmates structure
	- They know what will happen each day
	- How they will pass their time
- Provides protection from violence and bullying
- Normalises relations between prisoners and between prisoners and staff

# Disciplinary power
Drawing from [[Michel Foucault]]:
- Power is experienced as firm and soft at the same time
	- It's not typically applied via force
- Uncertainty: prisoners don't know what will happen after they'll be reeased
- Psychological assessments: constant interactions with guards and doctors to evaluate you
	- Determines the length of your sentence
	- Drives prisoners to self-regulate to be let out earlier
- Constant uncertainty if you're doing things by the rules
	- Thinking "Maybe my behaviour is wrong" all the time
	- Creates an invisible harness - tension
		- "power operates both closely and anonymously"

# Frameworks
- Western countries like strict regulations on prisons
- Prisons elsewhere (E.G Brazil) are less regulated and may be more violent
- You can't necessarily map knowledge between the two contexts

# Forms of order
This information comes from studies of Brazil and Guatemala

## State-produced
- Architecture
	- How the cells are laid out
	- Do prisoners have roommates?
	- Sight-lines of guards
	- Exercise yards
- Routine
	- When you're allowed to eat, exercise, and work

## Prisoner-produced
- Gangs form within prisons
- They may form in response to violence from guards or prisoners
	- Motivated by a need for safety via numbers
	- Inmates protect other inmates
- The PCC formed in these conditions in Brazil
	- Strict constitution and language guidelines
	- Regulating relationships between inmates
	- Organising riots
	- Who gets to sleep where
- Gangs stabilise the chaotic prison environment
- Expands outwith the prison as people are released
- Operates through networks among prisoners

## Co-produced
### Segregation
- Gangs are partitioned during prison activities to limit interactions between gangs
- Identify which gang an inmate is likely to be from
	- Look for tattoos
	- Where they were from
- Putting gangs in different prisons violates international rules about how people should be sent to prison
	- Inmates may be separated from family members
- Gang leaders are separated
- Dress codes limit gang uniforms

### Continuing gangs
- A member's status doesn't change when they go to prison
- Street dynamics are reproduced in prisons
- Graffiti and gang symbols mark territoryry
