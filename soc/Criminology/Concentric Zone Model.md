# Downtown
Central business area

# Zone of transition
- Poverty, prostitution, metal disorder, suicide, alcoholism, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, and disease are common here
- People move in and out all the time
	- Often immigrants
- Lots of [[Emile Durkheim#Pathological|pathological behaviour]]
- Bad housing, leading to poor health
- Divided ethnic groups
- Poor access to amenities
- Also weaker ties to methods of social control like family, school, and work

# Residential and commuter
- Lots of white collar workers
- Suburban middle class areas, typically

# How gangs form
Thrasher 1927:
- People come together spontaneously due to lack of resources
	- Poor economic mobility
	- Fractured families
	- Society has failed these people
- Gangs become chosen family
- Come about in places of poverty, high population density, overcrowding, and lots of young people

# Issues
- Labels entire areas as socially disorganised -> leads to stigma
- Communities may look disorganised from the outside, but aren't necessarily
- Only really applies to cities that grew with industrialisation
	- Most cities aren't like that nowow
