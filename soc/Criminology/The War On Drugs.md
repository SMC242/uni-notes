# History
- Ronald Reagan started a war on drug crime
- Aimed at black people
	- Black men have a 13x higher drug charge rate than white men

# Systemic incarceration
- Control of African-Africans moved from slavery -> Jim Crow laws -> urban ghettos -> the prison
	- Segregates African-Americans and extracts labour from them
- Incarceration rates vary between genders, but are still higher between black and white people
- The majority of people in prisons are people from racialised groups, creating a new ghetto
	- People get out and come back due to over-policing of these groups
	- Each sentence gets longer
	- Being separated from family and subjected to prison is traumatising, increasing the likelihood of going back to prison

# Reinforcement
- People see lots of black people going to prison and assume they are dangerous
	- Caused by structural discrimination
	- Denied cultural capital (poor access to education in black areas)
	- Excluded from social redistribution (welfare payments)
	- Excluded from political system (poor voting access in black areas, also can't vote in prison)
