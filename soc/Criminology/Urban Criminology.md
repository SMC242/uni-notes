# Summary
- Criminology looking at life in cities
- Views every settlement as networked with cities
	- People who live outside cities often come to the city
	- "Society has been completely urbanised" - Lefebvre
- Most people live in cities
	- 50% of the world's population
	- 1 billion people live in slums and shantytowns
	- 33 megacities (cities > 10km)
- Poor people tend to live in certain areas of the city

# Historical context
- Driven by the [[Chicago School]]
- Developed before wealth began to move from industrial cities to financial cities
	- See "The Global City"

![[Chicago School]]

# Globalisation
- Cities have become post-industrial
	- Shipbuilding moved away from Glasgow; steel from Chicago
- Finance is the new focus of cities
	- Banks
	- Start-up companies
- Working-class people struggle to find work in this new context
	- Communities that used to work in industry have collapsed
- 

# Fear
- Middle class people fear poorer people as they associate poor people with crime
	- Also links in with racism as people may view certain groups as prone to crime (E.G travellers, black people)
- They put up walls, hire guards, get dogs
- This causes spatial segregation -> "gated communities"
- This is assisted by the state by over-policing poor areas
- Patrols in rich areas are less violent, less common, and more predictable

# State vs gangs
- Gangs can be a response to government policies
- Gangs are then used as an excuse to attack those communities
	- E.G the war on drugs
- State intervention often further destabilises these communities
- Gangs often regulate violence in areas
