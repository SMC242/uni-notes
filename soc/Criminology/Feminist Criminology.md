# Aims
- Avoiding gender-blind assumptions
- Challenging andro-centrism
- Studying how gender is constructed in crime
- Giving women a voice

# Victimisation
- Looking at violence against women
- Study the role of patriarchal social structures in women's victimisation
- Avoiding victim-blaming as [[Positivism]] was prone to
	- Wolfgang and Amir blamed women for where they were, what time it was, and what they were wearing
- Focus on sexual violence and intimate partner violence
	- Sexual violence is used as a tool to control women
- Women are brought up to fear crime more as they are viewed as weak and sexual violence is a main way women are attacked

## The cycle of violence
- People who were abused as children increases the likelihood of offending
	- Found by Widom 1989

# Intersectionality
- Sexism doesn't exist on its own
- Institutionalised sexism usually appears with classism, racism, and other oppressions
- Led to [[Black Feminism]], [[Queer Feminism]], Aboriginal Feminism, and Third World Feminism

# Masculinity
- Asking the question of "what is it about masculinity that leads to crime?" relative to women
- Masculinity places importance on power, resources, and success
- Main places for masculine crime: the street, workplace, and home
- The expectation of being a breadwinner leads men to crime in order to provide for their families

## Identities
- Masculinity and femininity isn't the same everywhere
- Class, race, and other things affect an individual's perception of gendered expectations
