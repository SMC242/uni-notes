# Marxist approaches
- The mode of production affects the forms of punishments

- Late colonial age: penal labour used to colonies new places
- Industrial age: prisons are warehouses for surplus factory labour

# Securitisation
- 9/11 was used as an excuse to raise security
- This is directed at specific groups
	- In the case of 9/11: Muslims and immigrants
- The rise of security outside of prisons (fences, private guards, CCTV) coincides with the prominence of security
