# What?
- Coined by anthropologist [[Paul Topinard]]
	- The "science of understanding the criminal"
- Scientists of the time tried to find physical characteristics associated with criminality
	- [[Caesar Lombroso]] and [[William Ferrero]]
- It's the study of crime as a social phenomenon 
	- Making laws
	- Breaking laws
	- Reactions to broken laws
	- Treatment of crime (punishments, rehabilitation, systemic reforms)
- Very interdisciplinary

# Connections between Sociology and Criminology
- Sociology focuses on social order, but can also be used for social disorder
- Crime as a [[Emile Durkheim#Social facts|social fact]] 

## Studying the underlying processes
It's important to look at the processes that lead to crime
- Social control
- Routines
- Spatial ecology of cities
- How families and households are organised
- Circulation of goods (access to food, drugs)
- The work that's \[not\] available
- Powers of the state

> "Criminology's subject matter is centrally implicated in the major transformations of our time"
> \- David Garland

# Sociological approaches to crime
- Avoiding strawmen like the common imagination of criminals
- No such thing as biological criminals
- Challenging ideas that are assumed/taken for granted
- Looking at the wider social context that led to the crime

# The genesis of the criminological imagination
- Built on top of the [[Sociological Imagination]]
- Connecting individual experiences to social structures and historical context
- Crime is socially contructed
- The criminal is a social construct too
- Crime control and punishment are shaped by social influences
	- E.G some places want to be "tough on crime" while others focus on rehabilitation or prevention

# Durkheimian influences
- [[Emile Durkheim]] viewed law as the concrete and objective statement of morality within a society
	- His ideas came to be known as [[Functionalism]]
- Over time, punishments became less harsh
	- Societies used to publically execute people
	- Now they don't and laws have changed with it
- Crime has an important social function: reinforcing the boundaries of the group
	- Crime is inevitable
- Laws represent societal beliefs

## Deviance
- Marks the moral boundaries
	- Shows what is and isn't allowed within the society
- Collective outrage at deviants brings people together
	- Hate mobs, newspapers, and social media are used to group together to rage against deviance

## Purpose of punishment
- In Durkheim's view, punishment is an emotional reaction to the violation of the group's boundaries
- Punishment is a demonstration that the rules of the group still hold strong
- Public executions allowed people to gather and observe this reinforcement

## Anomie
See [[Emile Durkheim#Anomie]]

- When the social world changes rapidly, a state of anomie is created
	- E.G industrial revolution, increasing automation
- People become angry that they lost their job and may struggle to adapt to the new social climate
- In order to maintain their old standard of living, people turn to crime
	- This is usually property crime (theft)
- Social unhappiness -> violent crime 
	- To "satisfy unmet desires"

# Marxist critique of functionalism
- [[Karl Marx]] thought that we shouldn't see crime as a necessary part of society
	- Instead, we should look at the underlying causes
	- Note that he is not a criminologist - he focused on the socio-economic conditions
- He thought that crime is an expression of struggle against prevailing socio-economic and political conditions
	- In other words, crime reflects social relations and oppression
	- When people are disenfranchised, they act out
	- Crime is an act of resistance against the capitalist order
- Law is a tool of the capitalist class
- Offences committed by ruling classes are seen as less serious
	- White collar crime vs blue collar crime
- Moral panics affect how crimes are viewed
	- If there is an active moral panic about rockers, crimes committed by rockers will be elevated in the media

## Revolution
- Petty crimes don't take down power structures
- Instead, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] advocated for revolution

## Legacy
- Came to be known as [[Critical Criminology]]
- Looking at crimes of the powerful
	- Crimes of the state (genocides)
	- Corporate crimes (banks, environmental disaster)
	- State-corporate crimes (the state allowing corporate crimes to happen)
	- Crimes of globalisation (E.G the World Bank contributing to exploitation of the Global South)h)
