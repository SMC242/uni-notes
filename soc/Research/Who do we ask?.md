# Samples
- Who you sample drastically affects the conclusions reached
- If you ask only racist people about their thoughts on migrants, you will conclude that there is a lot of racism in the population 

# Pitfalls
- You usually don't know the full population
- The sample size may not be correct
- You may assume too little diversity
	- Diversity is the variety of individual groups contained within a population
- Not everyone in the population knows about or responds to the survey

# Sample design example
Referencing British Social Attitudes survey, 2013

- It used the Postcode Address File
	- That means people with permanent addresses
	- This excludes travellers
	- Businesses were filtered out (good)
- 18 or over
- Private households only
	- Excludes institutionalised people such as those in mental hospitals and prisons
