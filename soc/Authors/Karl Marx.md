# Historical Context
- Lived 1818 - 1883
	- Industrialisation 
	- Lots of poverty and ghettos
	- Classical liberalism was dominant in England
- From a secular Jewish family
- Went to Brussels, Paris, and London as a political refugee
	- Born in Prussia
	- Had to flee Prussia due to persecution over his articles
- Didn't work in academics. Was a journalist
- Friedrich Engels supported him financially
- Looked at how capitalism functions


# Approaches
- He moved away from the introspection and abstraction of classical philosophy, towards practicality and empirical evidence
	- Avoiding logical systems and thinking instead about real life examples
	- Also escaping ideas of "essence" - people are shaped by their material conditions

## Being, base and superstructure
Being determines consciousness. Base refers to the way people produce and their relationship with production This goes on to shape the superstructure of the society. Superstructure is the culture, ideas, and institutions 

Said differently: the conditions of the work people do shape the culture of the society. E.G post-industrial society may have led to BLM and Me Too (more liberal cultural movements) <-- from lecturer

# Social class
Marx saw two classes of people under capitalism that are constantly in tension with each other.

## Proletariat
Those who lack the means of production and must sell their labour to the Bourgeoisie

## Bourgeoisie 
Owns means of production and pays people to use them to produce things. Then sells the produce for a profit

# Exploitation
- The extraction of surplus labour
- Paying workers for less than the value of what they produce
	- E.G paying someone for 6 hours of production, but they work for 8
	- The 6 hours is enough to sustain the worker so they can continue to work
	- The extra 2 earns money for the capitalist
- The capitalist wants to increase the amount of surplus labour as much as possible in order to get more profits
	- Achieve through automation/better tools, longer work day
- "Industrial reserve army of labour" is the population of workers laid off due to technological improvements
- Capitalism tends towards centralisation (monopoly) as capitalists out-compete each other. This is self-destructive

# Stages of society
He thought that all societies would follow the path of Feudalism --> Capitalism --> Socialism

Marx' writing focused a lot on the transition between Feudalism and Capitalism

# Uses
- Marx' writing is the foundation of many socialisms
- Marxist ideas are applied across academics, both cultural and economic 

# Pitfalls
- The global revolution he predicted never happened
	- Expecting that it will happen if things just get bad enough for workers
- Can be reductionist (expecting all capitalists to think the same)
- Not intersectional
	- Ignores other axes of oppression and views liberation of the working class as paramount
- Marx' writing led to a lot of authoritarianism 
	- Very harsh towards his opponents
