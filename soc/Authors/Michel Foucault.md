# Historical context
- Wrote about the birth of the prison

# Punishment
- Punishment affects either the body or the soul
- Executions and torture act on the body
- Isolation and control act on the soul

## Control
- Isolation
- Strict timetabling (no control over what you do)

# Why do we punish?
- We used to do it for retribution
- Now we try to correct the criminal by punishing the criminal
- Aims to produce "docile bodies" via:
	- Hierarchical observation
	- Normalising judgement
	- Examination

# Hierarchical observation
- Overseers watch people and check if they are following the rules
![[Panopticon]]

# Normalising judgment
- Behaviours are categorised as right or wrong
- Everyone's actions are ranked according to their rightness
	- Children put in reading groups according to their reading ranking
- Constant threat of being "unnormal" pushes people to behave

# Examination
- Combination of [[#Hierarchical observation]] and [[#Normalising judgment]]
- Your rightness is observed and subsequently evaluated

# Uses
- These ideas of control can be applied outside of prisons
	- Universities: go to class, sit an exam
	- Work: go to work, be on time or be fired/disciplined, meet your goals

# Limitations
- No mentions of systemic pressures like racism
- In his view, power is dispersed throughout society
- There is no dominant class applying these methods of control
- Not very useful outwith a Western context
