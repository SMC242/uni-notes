# Historical context
- Lived 1897 - 1990
- Middle class Jewish person in Poland
- Moved to Frankfurt but was exiled for being Jewish

# Methods
- Moving away from staged systems to static analysis
	- E.G Feudal stage -> Capitalist stage -> Socialist stage -> Communist stage as in [[Karl Marx]]'s writing
	- He viewed these systems as prophetic - assumption that one stage necessarily leads to the next
- Doubt in science, cautious trust in our senses
- Moving towards statistical procedures (empirical studies)

# Figurations
The method of looking at the relationships within society such as economic and political. Uses the combination of macro stuff like a nation's rules with everyday experiences like [[#Table manners]]

Elias looked at how different states emerged. He concluded that they came about via changing ways of dominating others. For example, in the medieval ages, someone would have to directly threaten another person. Next, representatives were used to manage those under them. The methods become increasingly *impersonal*

As this progresses, more and more layers of representatives come into being. This distributes power in exchange for greater reach. This creates a monolithic entity that holds the *monopoly on physical violence*. Due to their far-reaching power, society becomes less dangerous (E.G less risk of being robbed while travelling). In some ways, more freedom is conferred - or rather - new freedoms and pleasures.

Individuals are more restrained as they can't just attack someone else because they will be punished. Rather than defending our physical well-being, we have to rationalise the way society is structured. When someone gets embarrassed about public nudity, they are reacting to the violation of a social norm

- Drawing from [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Sigmund Freud]]
- He thought it was important to see how things develop over time 
	- E.G how roles in society are passed down within a family

# Civilisation as a process
- Instincts are channelled into sports
	- Aggression -> fighting sports
	- Cooperation -> team sports
- Small rules begin to manage social interactions
- Even wars begun to have more rules

## Table manners
- They became more complex over time
- Books on the topic began to appear
- These rules trickle down from the upper classes to the lowest classes

## Soccer
- It began with large teams, more contact, and hands allowed
- Rules became stricter and less violent
- It became a "civilised" sport

# De-civilisation
- When societies become more violent
- Happens in spurts
- People return to instincts
	- May be influenced by the country's history
	- E.G Germany unified late, so people may in-fight more whereas English people may not

# Uses

# Limitations
- Limited view of civilisation and violence
	- Physical violence is not the only way to control people
	- Psychological violence can be used (E.G indoctrination to believe that you are lesser via education)
- Focused on European cultures
- Ignores the functions of civilised things in society
	- Football has become very profitable. It is a business now
	- A common set of rules has allowed the sport to become international
	- This benefits team owners as they make lots of money
