# Historical Context
- Lived 1864 - 1920
- University professor
- Took part in German imperialism
- In an intellectual environment of German idealism
	- Philosophers tended to stay in the realm of ideas
	- Marxism and Rationalism moved towards something more modelled after the natural sciences
- Intellectuals at the time felt threatened by Rationalism
	- They ended up supporting the rise of German nationalism

# Methods
- Draws on [[Historical Materialism]]
	- Uses culture and general thought to build on this framework
- Tries to apply more empathy to natural scientific analysis
- Thought about the practicality of socialism
	- Questions of implementation such as government, who fills essential roles like teachers
- His social class model is more complex than [[Karl Marx]]'s dialectic
- Looked at the material context of groups, then the specific cases of those groups (their experiences) via studies

# Verstehen and Ideal-types
- The practice of singling out the cause and effect relationship behind an action
- He looked at the Protestant ethic and how that informed the values of capitalist societies
	- Anxiety about going to Heaven drives a disciplined lifestyle and working hard to be successful financially
	- This is to try and make sure that they go to Heaven
- This Protestant spirit became so widespread that it drove capitalism into a strong social system
- Protestant values became imprinted in capitalism
	- Yet societies have become increasingly secular. This is called disenchantment

# Types of actions (rationalisations)
He felt that as a society modernises, it moves down this list of motivations. Moving away from religion and tradition towards bureaucracy and legal systems

### Traditional
How things have always been done

### Affectual
Impulse from emotions

### Value-rational
Following the logic of an ideal or value system

### Instrumental-rational
Working towards a goal

# Uses
- Big academic impact
	- Drawn on by Mills and Parsons
- Bourdieu and Goffman criticised his work, but ultimately thought it was useful
- The UK class system is based on his ideas

# Limitations
- How are ideal types formed?
	- How did his classes come about?
- Clunky definitions
	- Social actions are where people relate to each other
	- Non-social actions do not relate with another person
		- Opening an umbrella is non-social to him because the person wants to protect themself
		- Social anthropologists have revealed that hiding from the rain is a learned behaviour as some societies stay outside
	- Rational decisions follow some logic
		- A capitalist investing in stocks
	- Irrational decisions don't
		- Kicking a wall in anger
- He tries to build his theories from impressions rather than a web of concepts
	- Committing too hard to this leads to ethnocentrism due to the biases of the observer
	- E.G looking at other groups of people and stating that they are irrational because they don't make sense from your cultural point of view
	- Provides cover for bigotry because they can just say that they're just describing things as they see them
