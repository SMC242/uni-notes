# Historical context
- Lived 1860 - 1935
- Middle class religious background, poor
- Existed in economic precarity for most of her life
- Novelist
- Tumultuous love life
	- Reluctant to marry (weird at the time)
	- Divorced
	- Gave away her daughter
	- Found out she had cancer and killed herself
- Protestant values being pushed on people
- Darwinism was popular (ideas of instincts and natural selection)
- Women had few rights
	- No voting
	- Dependent on the men in their lives

## Unnatural mother
- People judge a mother for focusing on her child

# Methods
- Social Darwinism 
	- Applying ideas of instincts and evolution to the social world

# Patriarchy
- Assumes physiological differences between men and women
	- This is the "original natural state"
	- Norms came about that wrapped the natural state (the creation of gender?)
	- Relative equality before society comes in
- Society grew to be patriarchal from a state of equality
	- Narrowing spaces and experiences for women
	- Women played less of a role in production than in the Stone Age
	- Women went from active participants to economically dependent on their representatives (fathers and husbands)
	- Quite inspired by [[Norbert Elias]]
- She said that women went from being perceived as "tall, vigorous, and beautiful" to "feeble and clumsy" while still doing a lot of labour
	- Women are not recognised for the labour they do
	- Domestic labour is not paid
	- No politicians represented them
- A second nature/instinct came into being - sex roles
	- Socially constructed
	- Women are expected to being pretty, look for a husband, and aspire to be a mother

# Literature as a tool
- Using fiction as a tool for sociological critique via subtext
- Sociology exists somewhere between the humanities and hard sciences
- Using books to communicate sociological messages via subtext

## Why?
- More accessible due to less jargon
- More engaging to average people

# Herland
- A fiction about a Utopian society composed of women
	- Ecofeminist
- Some men discover it and eventually integrate into it
- Gender roles were reversed
	- Strong, able, active women
	- Passive, clumsy men
- Less violence, more community
	- Children raised communally
	- Motherhood doesn't take over the mother's life
- Ecologically sustainable


# Uses
- Second-wave feminism

# Limitations
- Very biological view of gender
	- Has a concept of "normal sexing"
	- Taking aspects of gender to be universal
	- Comparing women with horses and cows to say that horses aren't that different between sexes -> human gender relations should be the same
	- Exclusive of intersex people
- Narrow view of feminimity
	- Obsessed with being rational and factual
- Herland represents a reversal of the patriarchy, not emancipation
	- Does not defeat the norms that make patriarchy bad, just turns them back on men
	- overly masculine or feminine visions according to [[Virginia Woolf]]
- Advocating for re-enslavement
	- Following from Darwinism, every group within a species has its place. That is the logic
	- Racial planning to change society into her vision (eugenicist)
