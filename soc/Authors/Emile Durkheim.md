# Historical Context
- Rabbi (Jewish priest)
- Lived between 1858 and 1917 (same time as Weber)
- Sociology was not an organised field at the time
	- He tried to build the discipline
	- He uses lots of words from the natural sciences to gain credibility
		- Natural sciences are physics, biology, and chemistry
- He takes very objective stances, which could be considered as outdated
- Father of [[Functionalism]]

# Social facts
Things that exist outside individuals and are forced upon them. They are usually long-standing concepts

- Money
- Religion
- Being expected to with people a happy birthday
- Expected to see family

Yet someone had to create them at some point. Then they must be reproduced enough that it becomes a fact

He doesn't put much weight in how people feel. He's trying to find objective patterns. This comes from trying to cement sociology as a science akin to the natural sciences. He tries to imagine life from outside usual experience. His method is to pretend that you don't know anything - to peel back the assumptions and learned behaviours

Social facts exert pressure on individuals. This is called "resistance". If you are a parent and don't want your child to have an iPhone, but the other kids have one, you will feel pressured to get them one. 

His goal was to observe these social facts in order to understand them and eventually change them.

## Social facts as a field
Durkheim created this topic. It tends to focus on tradition, customs, and religious beliefs. 


# Solidarity
## Early societies
"Mechanical solidarity" becuase the whole society is moving together, like a car

### Sameness
- People are very connected
- Little division of labour
	- Little to no specialisation and eduation
- Shared religion
- Rural

### Strong [[Collective Consciousness]]
- Powerful, restrictive laws

Ferdinand Tonnies called this "community". He said that modern societies have replaced that with "association"

## Modern societies
"organic solidarity" because people interact with each other as they need to. Exchanges are powered by specific needs like their bike needing fixed or installing central heating

- Highly divided labour
	- Specialisation
	- Education
- Loosely or not bound at all by a common religion
- Multicultural
- Cities
- Belief in [[Individualism]]
- 

# Division of labour

# Anomie
When people dislike their position in society, anomie comes in. It is a lack of regulation and rules; social disintegration. This is often a drastic change in social position or a societal change
- Losing your job
- Becoming rich or poor suddenly

## Normal
Fulfils a function in society

Durkheim said that crimes are useful for establishing the boundaries of a society. It demonstrates the limits to people. If you kill someone, you go to jail

## Pathological

# Uses
The following authors and fields draw on Durkheim:
- Goffman  (criminology)
- Bordieu (sociology)

# Pitfalls
- Absolute facts are considered to be socially constructed today
- Unclear relationship between facts and everyday experiences
	- Tries to use statistics to make conclusions about social reality, but doesn't look at the subjective reasons
- Didn't care much about power structures (and their fairness)
