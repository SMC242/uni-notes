- Anti-discrimination laws in Germany have been made such that the institutions are immune
	- This is deeply unhelpful because they are a major place where discrimination occurs
	- In order to relieve systemic racism in Germany, these laws must be adjusted to give legal footing to push institutions to be better
- People tend to not acknowledge race as a valid category anymore, despite it still being valuable as modern discrimination definitely operates on race rather than more granular terms like "ethnicity"
- Germany has a problem of trying to put racism in the past, as if it instantly ended after WW2. America has a similar problem with Martin Luther King
	- This leads to people forgetting what happened outwith WW2 such as the Spanish conquets, Dutch Massacres in Indonesia, and Belgian violence in the DRC
	- Europeans tend to offload racism as only existing in America, yet American racism has its foundation in Europe
	- American and European far-right wingers often share rhetoric, showing that they are linked
- People avoid looking at systemic racism by blaming it on the individual
