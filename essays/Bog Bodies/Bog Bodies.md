2. “He should not be here, he should be back in the bog”. Evaluate the arguments for and against the display of ‘bog bodies’ to the public using TWO case studies.

Bog bodies provide a unique snapshot into the past - a near-perfect model of what past people looked like. Yet they were once people. They are not like other artefacts - they lived, ate, and slept just like us. This presents a difficult issue that archaeologists and museum curators must confront: how can researchers respect the dead while still advancing the field of archaeology? Furthermore, who gets to make that decision?

Before inspecting the discourse around the issue, it is key to understand what bog bodies are and why they are so interesting. Under normal circumstances, corpses break down into their constituent parts and return to the earth. Yet these bodies have remained intact - so much so that expressions can be observed in some cases. This is due to high PH levels in the water and the protection they provide from oxygen. Skin, hair, and organs remain, while bones and clothes disintegrate as normal. Examining their skin for scars can reveal the conditions of their deaths and their hair, nails, and stomach contents can yield information about their diet.

Beyond the physical aspects of these bodies, the circumstances of their deaths provide a glimpse into the religious and judicial practices of the time. In many cases from the Iron Age, it appears that the person had been executed[^sacrifices]. This shows that bogs had some significance for executions. Additionally, some specimens have been discovered in respectful positions, wrapped in sheepskin capes such as the Elling Woman, Tollund Man, and Huldremose Woman. This indicates that these killings were not all judicial in nature and it is believed that many were in fact sacrifices. Bogs may have been chosen due to the fact that the bodies sink into the water, appearing to be absorbed or eaten. Alternatively, it could be due to the masses of dead flora floating in the bog water. It is possible that bogs were seen as natural graveyards.

While bogs may have been seen as obvious resting places, the same cannot be said for museums. In the case of the Graubelle Man, 

In Germany, a museum that contains six bog specimens maintains a poll box. In this box, visitors are encouraged to post their opinions on the exhibit to be collated yearly. While the 2001 results are commonly used to argue in favour of such exhibitions, there are a number of issues with the sample. The largest issue is the sample size of only 246. This shrinks down to a minuscule 72 when you only consider adult responses. This sample size is insufficient to make conclusions about the broader population. Beyond that, the types of people who are likely to comment must be brought into question: those who disagree with the exhibit may simply not visit and poorer individuals are less likely to visit museums as they have less free time[^visitors]. What this study can tell us is the media response is not necessarily the same as public opinion. The rates of dissent are significantly lower than what one would expect, given the media coverage. While this study is insufficient, the topic certainly warrants a more thorough investigation using a larger and more diverse sample. Such a study would provide an excellent view of German views on the display of bog bodies.
