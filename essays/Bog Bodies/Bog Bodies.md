2. “He should not be here, he should be back in the bog”. Evaluate the arguments for and against the display of ‘bog bodies’ to the public using TWO case studies.

Bog bodies provide a unique snapshot into the past - a near-perfect model of what past people looked like. Yet they were once people. They are not like other artefacts - they lived, ate, and slept just like us. This presents a difficult issue that archaeologists and museum curators must confront: how can researchers respect the dead while still advancing the field of archaeology? Furthermore, who gets to make that decision?

Before inspecting the discourse around the issue, it is key to understand what bog bodies are and why they are so interesting. Under normal circumstances, corpses break down into their constituent parts and return to the earth. Yet these bodies have remained intact - so much so that expressions can be observed in some cases. This is due to high PH levels in the water and the protection they provide from oxygen. Skin, hair, and organs remain, while bones and clothes disintegrate as normal. Examining their skin for scars can reveal the conditions of their deaths and their hair, nails, and stomach contents can yield information about their diet.

Beyond the physical aspects of these bodies, the circumstances of their deaths provide a glimpse into the religious and judicial practices of the time. In many cases from the Iron Age, it appears that the person had been executed[^sacrifices]. This shows that bogs had some significance for executions, such as human sacrifices. Perhaps this was because the bodies sink into the water, appearing to be absorbed or eaten.
