# Differing outcomes based on gender
[[Intersectional and Biosocial Approaches to Health]]
The performance of a particular gender may lead to differing health outcomes. Examples:
- Autism is diagnosed more in boys than girls, since it appears differently as a result of gendered treatment while growing up
- Mothers may prioritise feeding their children over their own needs. This is a result of the social expectation that their children's needs should be paramount to a mother
- 90% of workplace suicides are men [source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45012652?seq=1)

# Mental health
As illustrated in [[#Differing outcomes based on gender]], gender affects health outcomes. This is particularly true 
Begin with [[Health of the Invisible Population]] and explain that health outcomes for trans people are worse.

Use [[Health Status of Trans and NB Adults]] to show that health outcomes are not equal among trans people. Additionally, data was hard to find on NB people, linking into [[#Social construction of gender impacting health systems|paragraph 1]]

Wait times for gender clinics in the Central Belt of Scotland range between 2 and more than 3 years. Access is poor.

# Stigma and violence
[[Health At The Margins of Society]]
Focus on the "Rights and health" heading

Trans people face home insecurity and difficulty staying in school which combines with stigma to make it hard to find work. The hardship getting mainstream work leads into the prevalence of sex work, which may partially explain the high HIV rates of trans people. Other explanations: worse education outcomes = worse sexual education --> unsafe sex

These outcomes are caused by working conditions.

# Stigma's impact on mental health
Use [[Trans Stigma Study]] to back up [[#Stigma]]. Note that nonbinary people are excluded from this study, linking back to [[#Health impacts on trans folks]]

# Lack of data and possible impacts on health


# Conclusion
## Limitations
It is hard to find data on trans people and this is particularly true in Scotland. As a result, it's difficult to inform changes to healthcare systems and policy. What is clear from the studies examined in this essay is mental health outcomes are poor transgender individuals. This is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from discrimination from people within their social network, to inadequate support 
There is little data on transgender people generally, but practically no data in Scotland. As a result, this analysis may not map onto Scotland.
