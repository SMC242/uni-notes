- Study on health outcomes of trans people
- Great supporting evidence
- Location: USA

- Trans men have worse health outcomes than trans women and enbies
- Among trans people who have health insurance, enbies have worse health outcomes than binary trans people
- Trans mascs were more likely to be uninsured, which was associated with 7x higher chance of bad health
- Trans people who are not heterosexual have worse health
- The data on NB patients was limited - study calls for further study on NB people

Build on [[Health of the Invisible Population]] by showing that being trans masc or NB worsens health; health is not equal among trans people
