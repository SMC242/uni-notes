Marcel Mauss' essay *"The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies"* is considered to be a foundational paper in the field of anthropology. Yet some would question its usefulness in the modern day, given that it was published nearly a century ago. In this essay, I will analyse the extent that his most famous piece can assist us in understanding current social phenomena.

Mauss' essay presents a framework wherein a gift represents a contract that materialises and reinforces relationships. The contract implicit within a gift has three responsibilities: to give, to receive, and to return. Interestingly, this implies that gifts are not singular events, but part of a flowing cycle. Gifts flow from one individual to another and continue to do so for as long as the relationship stands. Mauss then posits that this system of responsibility is core to society

These contracts may be used for political, economic, or social reasons. Furthermore, he demonstrates that gifts are key tools for maintaining peace by examining three examples of gift giving: the potlatch ceremony, the hau, and the Kula ring. I will explore each of these cases with reference to modern applications.

The most interesting of these examples for contemporary use is the potlatch feast. During such a feast gifts are exchanged between tribes in a competitive manner: chieftains attempt to out-do each other by giving ever grander prizes to their peers and discarding valuable items given to them[^Potlatch]. Sharing the most valuable objects and throwing away as much value as possible yields status, as it shows to their fellow chieftains that they have a surplus of wealth. Such a ritual cements the hierarchy of tribes by placing low-ranking tribes in debt to those who have more resources at their disposal via the responsibility to reciprocate. This is an example of "competitive" or "antagonistic"[^gift] gifting. Despite attempts by the Candian government to extinguish the practice, potlatches remain crucial to the political systems of some indigenous cultures in North America. 

Gifts as demonstrations of wealth can be observed across the world today, particularly in foreign aid. Countries attempt to show their prosperity, morality, and generosity by sending resources to nations in crisis. However, it also places the receivers at the bottom of the hierarchy as their debts to the wealthy countries increases. This is one way that countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom, and China maintain their power on the world stage. Methods such as these form a new colonialism where debts are used in place of  occupation.

Beyond creating a hierarchy between countries, this usage of debt prevents the recipients from developing, which is crucial to globalisation. As a country develops, worker's rights improve and therefore labour becomes more expensive. This causes capitalists to move production to countries with weaker protections for labourers so they can increase their profit margins. Moving to such countries allows the produce to remain cheap for those in rich countries while still enjoying their rights. It is in the interests of these capitalists for the host country to not prove its labour protections, thus its is beneficial for givers of aid to avoid investing in infrastructure and instead only provide temporary aid. Only through a Maussian lens can this cycle of aid be understood.

Older anthropological papers such as *"The Gift"* are not without their flaws. Chief among them is the patronising notion of a "primitive" or "archaic" society. Who gets to decide what "primitive" looks like? It is a term that is fundamentally subjective, yet writers such as Mauss failed to examine what assumptions were beneath their usage of the phrase.
