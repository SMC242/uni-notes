3. Explain the notion of the ‘naturalization’ of social relations and how it illuminates the connection between sexism and racism.

Sexism and racism are both afflictions of societies new and old. While they appear disparate concepts, they have one common thread: they are both based on identities that have been coerced into reality. Through constant reinforcement of their boundaries, sex, gender, and race have become concepts that continue to be used to justify hierarchies in everyday life. This is the process of naturalisation and the focus of this paper. 

Gender is a system that is constantly in flux. The expectations and roles attached to a gender change drastically over time and space, yet it appears to be a fact of life without inspection through a sociological lens. Judith Butler explains gender as something subjects must persistently "perform" in signal gender[^gender]. Subjects are told early in life that they have been assigned a sex, and throughout their lives learn through observation or discipline how they are expected to behave. Violation of these rules leads to social recourse and this recourse can push a subject to the margins of society. The resulting marginalisation is how the edges of gender are maintained. Key to their theory is the usage of the word "subject", as it indicates that a person experiences gender but gender is not part of their essence. Moving beyond gender, Butler contests the usefulness of sex as a concept. They argue that sex cannot be expressed without drawing on assumptions learned from other subjects and the subject's own understanding of the world informed by their ideology[^sex]. This means that a subject's understanding of sex is a product of the society they exist within. It, too, is a social construct. Only through naturalisation do they become real. 

Race is also supposedly informed by unbiased observation of biological characteristics. Races are largely constructed as groupings of phenotypic traits which are assumed to be indicative of a person's beliefs, culture, and temperament. This is a greatly reductive way of categorising ethnicities, as there is massive cultural diversity within "races". Continental origin is also used to categorise subjects into races, however an arbitrary cut-off point must be used to do this as all humans originated in Africa. This cut-off is often chosen retroactively in order to support conclusions based on phenotype. Furthermore, 87-91% of genetic variation appears *within* continents, while only 9-13% of variation is found between continents[^genes]. The assertion that races are significantly different in terms of genetics simply does not hold. Despite this, people continue to assign traits to perceived ethnic groupings and use them to justify persecution. 

The notion of the technologically and philosophically ascendant coloniser bringing law, science, morality, and efficiency to primitive peoples powered colonialism for centuries. Scientists scrambled to find evidence to justify these ideas of superiority via methods such as measuring skull sizes and claiming that desert-based societies were backwards because they did not use wheels. During the transatlantic slave trade, black people were portrayed as violent sub-humans that needed to be tamed and were subject to horrendous violence during their journey across the sea. The notion that black people were inherently lesser to their white counterparts was crucial to the ideology of slavery because it allowed societies to be built upon slave labour while maintaining the illusion of morality. Women were subject to the most soul-crushing violence in order to break their spirits. They were targeted for this because women were, and still are, perceived as better at domestic labour. Working in the home meant working near the white slave owners, so the slavers had to ensure that the female slaves would not harm their masters[^hooks]. Due to their naturalised role as carers and anti-black attitudes of the slavers, black women had to endure violence that went beyond that which was received by black men.

Despite the clear ways that racism and sexism intersect, white feminists have often ignored the experiences of racialised women. This may happen due to explicit racism, or by simply choosing to not listen or assign priority to  other experiences. This has repeatedly led to disagreement and fragmentation of the feminist movement, as marginalised women feel that mainstream feminism does not front their needs or see them as equals.
