# Transgender people
- Transgender people expose the process by which all people learn how to be categorised as a particular sex
- In order to pass, transgender people have to learn what it is to perform their gender
- Cisgender people have picked this up over the course of their lives. Transgender people must do this in a shorter period of time in order to pass as their gender
- They try to be seen as a normal female/male by doing the gender activities of their sex category
- They may also get surgeries on their genitals in order to conform their genitals to the sex category they mean to embody
- I do find this a little problematic because it implies that all trans people want to pass, but I suppose that's not within the scope of the author's argument

# Assumptions
- We assume that sex category = a person's sex
- People use a sort of "duck test" to categorise sex
	- "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck"
- Someone not comforming to gender behaviours does not necessarily change their sex category
	- "Women can be seen as unfeminine, but that does not make them "unfemale""

# Performing gender
- Media depicts perfect versions of masculinity and feminimity but reproducing them like guides wouldn't work. Gender behaviours must be adapted to the circumstances
