# Question
1.  Why is it important to adopt an intersectional approach to the study of genders and/or sexualities? Answer using at least two pieces of illustrative social research from the course readings.

# Reading list
## Doing Gender
- Use this to show how gender is a social construct
- Use the idea of patriarchy as an intermediate in the transition to black feminism

## Ain't I A Woman
- An account of how blackness and womanhood combined to create unqiue oppression for slaves
- Use to show how different identities join together to create issues that others don't face
- This would not be picked up by a non-intersectional analysis
[[Ain't I A Woman]]

## Race in Germany and Europe
- Talk about how institutions reinforce this oppression
- "Unfortunately, intersectionality is not taken seriously in many places."

## How women do gender in the workplace, in comparison to men
- Use this to show that women have to make themselves appear less feminine in order to be taken seriously

## How trans men do gender at work
- Building on the last study:
- Due to their transness, they have to prove their masculinity in order to be taken seriously

# Headings
## Introduction
- Analyses of gender are incomplete without taking into account other aspects of a person's identity
- The intersection of different groups can create unique issues

#  Blackness meets womanhood
## Transition
- Agnes saw how she had to act in order to be perceived as a woman
- Bell Hook looked at how others acted towards women, particularly black women
## Point
- During slavery, blackness combined with womanhood to have extra layers of fear

## Evidence
- The threat of rape was always present. Black men didn't have to contend with this
- Their children were targeted
- They were expected to produce even more cotton than black men because women are expected to be good at delicate tasks
- They were abused even more brutally on the slave ships because women tended to work closely with their masters. This meant that the slavers had to ensure that the female slaves were too traumatised to rise against their masters

## Evaluation
- Sexual violence integrated into the existing relationship of terrorism between white owner and African slave
- Women faced harsher abuse and tougher expectations as labourers

## Link
This is an example of their racial identity intersecting with their sex categorisation to cause greater oppression 

# Conclusion
- My analysis focused on Europe and North America
	- It could be improved by looking at other places, such as South Africa, Rhodesia (modern day Zimbawe), and how colonialism affected local gender relations
- My analysis doesn't cover non-binary people, other races than white and black people, and religion
