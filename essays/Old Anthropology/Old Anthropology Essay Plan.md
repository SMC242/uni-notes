# Question
5. 'The work of anthropologists published before the year 2000 is not worth reading  
today.' Discuss with reference to ONE of the following anthropologists covered in the  
course: Marcel Mauss; Zora Neale Hurston; Margaret Mead; Max Gluckman.  

# Points
- An introduction to Marcel Mauss' "The Gift"
- Useful for understanding the contractual nature of gifts
	- 3-stage obligation: 
	- Gifts create a loop that reinforce relationships
	- Gifts materialise a relationship (see [[Gift Exchange#Maori traditions]])
	- This gives context to the modern colonial method of foreign aid: rich countries give poorer/in crisis countries gifts and they provide cheap labour in exchange
- Modern colonialism through a Maussian lens:
	- Rich countries give poor countries gifts of social engineering projects
	- However, they don't help the countries to develop themselves
	- The poorer country then becomes dependent on the gifts
	- What can it give back? Weak worker's protections --> cheap labour

- Issue: book title "The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in **Archaic Societies**"
	- What does it mean to be archaic?
	- Who gets to decide that?
	- The notion of a society being primitive is patronising
	- A society develops according to its needs
	- [On "primitive societies"](https://historyreclaimed.co.uk/is-there-a-primitive-society/)
- The year 2000 is arbitrary. It may be better to choose the 1980s that is when the field began to move beyond this idea of "archaic societies"
	- This notion has been critiqued since the 1980s (Kuper 1988, Leach 1982) -> anthropology has moved on from this idea
