> 4.  What and how convincing are arguments to abolish prison. Critically address this question sociologically.

The prison abolition movement has a long and storied history. It has its roots in the anti-slavery movement and has been propelled into modern debate by black feminists. Yet only in recent years has it began to gain major traction and has been met with equal skepticism.

Understandably so, as abolitionists pose a complete transformation of society. As Moten/Harney[^moten-harney] wrote:
> \[Prison abolitionists aim for\] Not so much the abolition of prisons, but the abolition of a society that could have prisons

Here, they assert that abolition is not just the elimination of the carceral system, but the reformation of society in order to better handle criminality. This means constructing systems to support victims, help pay back the harm caused by offenders, and prevent further crimes from occurring. Abolitionists posit that the prison system fails on all counts.

This approach is grounded in Michel Foucault's work in *"Discipline and Punish"* where he argues that the conditions within prisons are the product of the surrounding society[^foucault]. The same methods of observation used to pressure inmates to regulate their behaviour are used on children from a young age. Classrooms are arranged such that the teacher can see all the students, making each of them feel like they would be caught if they stepped out of line. In the workplace, constant deadlines and performance checks are imposed on employees. Their livelihood is contingent on meeting these goals. This illustrates the need to expand conversations of decarceration beyond the prison.

Foucault's theories are not without drawbacks. For one, it doesn't account for systemic pressures such as racism, sexism, and classism. Much work has been done in the American branch of the decarceration movement, drawing from their history of slavery. Abolitionists argue that slavery did not disappear with the 13th Amendment - it merely transformed as capitalism grew. Its modern form is the prison-industrial complex, an idea coined by Davis and Davis
