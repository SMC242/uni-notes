> 4.  What and how convincing are arguments to abolish prison. Critically address this question sociologically.

The prison abolition movement has a long and storied history. It has its roots in the anti-slavery movement and has been propelled into modern debate by black feminists. Yet only in recent years has it began to gain major traction and has been met with equal skepticism.

> \[Prison abolitionists aim for\] Not so much the abolition of prisons, but the abolition of a society that could have prisons
