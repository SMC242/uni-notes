# Question
2. Do we need a sociological canon? Discuss with reference to at least TWO writers (Ã‰mile Durkheim; Karl Marx; Max Weber; Norbert Elias; Charlotte Perkins Gilman) covered in the section.

# Points
- Writers that disagreed heavily. One came after the other and built on their predecessor's work
	- There are many different frameworks that can explain the same events
	- Therefore, if a sociological canon was to exist, it must have a variety of viewpoints on each issue
	- In this essay, I will look at two writers who focused on the development of capitalism and class, but formed two very different frameworks
- Marx's view of social class
	- Dialectic between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie 
		- Also the petite bourgeoisie who owned some means of production but not lots
	- Capitalism has 4 fundamental contradictions:
		- There are more workers than capitalists
		- In order to increase profits, the worker must become more and more productive without their wages improving. They will eventually be unable to pay for their own produce
		- The planet can't sustain growth forever
	- He asserted that these contradictions would grow until society reached a breaking point and revolution would occur
- Weber's view of class
	- Weber thought that class was not as simple as two classes defined based on their relationship with the means of production
	- He agreed that property (I.E means of production) were one parameter for class
		- Power via inherited wealth is rationalised via tradition
	- Power is another parameter: the ability to affect others and history to benefit oneself
		- Legal power is an example of value-rational
		- Rich people push for legal protections for their wealth
	- Prestige is based on occupation. A doctor is more prestigious than a waiter
		- Greater barrier to entry: higher education
		- Also may be discriminated against based on their race and gender
	- 
> The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things
- Areas of disagreement
	- Marx' view was a dialectic, while Weber broke up classes more
	- Marx thought that society would get increasingly polarised until it reached a boiling point and the capitalist order was overthrown
	- Weber disagreed
	- Weber thought that people had power via rationalisations such as value-rationality, tradition, and affect
	- Marx thought 
> Sociology is an esoteric science that has all appearances of being exoteric. Therefore modes of producing representations of the world that would be discredited in other scientific domains can survive even in the highest positions in the sociological field as long as they are granted a social authority capable of offsetting their technical, logical, and empirical inadequacies.

- If there is a canon, bad theories can be cemented into academic thought
