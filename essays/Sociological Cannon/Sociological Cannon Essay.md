2. Do we need a sociological canon? Discuss with reference to at least TWO writers (Ã‰mile Durkheim; Karl Marx; Max Weber; Norbert Elias; Charlotte Perkins Gilman) covered in the section.

Karl Marx and Max Weber are extremely influential writers that have undeniably shaped sociology. They have become staples of introductory sociology classes and are the basis of many systems of thought, even in other disciplines such as criminology. They both spent their lives investigating the formation of capitalism and its internal logic, yet reached different conclusions. Their lack of agreement demonstrates that there are many frameworks that can explain the same events, showing that it is questionable if it is possible to summarise the field of sociology with a small set of theories. 

It is important to note that Marx died before Weber began to write on the topic. The disagreements between their works were not debates between contemporaries. Rather, Weber critiqued Marx' framework and built his own based on the shortcomings he perceived in his predecessor's theories.

The main area that the two theorists disagreed was on their definition of social class. For Marx, class is a dialectic - a conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Each class was defined by their relationship with the means of production: the bourgeoisie own the factories and tools used to produce ("capital"), and the proletarians sell their labour to the bourgeoisie. He also defined a subset of the owner class called the "petite bourgeoisie" as small-scale owners such as people who own a small business rather than a franchise.

At the core of capitalism, Marx saw a conflict between these two classes. The proletariat desires better pay for less work, and the bourgeoisie seek higher profits. In order to earn a living without producing, the bourgeoisie must live off of the excess value produced by those in their employ. This "surplus value" is the difference between the exchange value of the produce, the price of the raw materials, and the wage of the worker. There are two ways for this margin to be increased: either the worker must produce more efficiently, or the worker must work for longer while receiving the same pay. In either case, the worker produces more than they are paid. Due to this tension over pay, Marx foresaw that workers would continue to earn less while producing more until they could no longer buy their own goods, resulting in the collapse of the system. Furthermore, Marx expected that capitalism's drive for ever-increasing profits would lead the owner class to drain the Earth of its resources until the point of ecological collapse. It is hotly debated if these predictions have come true, however the concept of the bourgeoisie and proletariat having competing interests has underpinned many later theories.

Max Weber found this understanding of class to be reductive. In his view, class was the combination of property, power, and prestige. He agreed with Marx that owning the means of production - property - granted much status, however he asserted that it was possible to own property without having a high social class. Exemplifying this inconsistency is the conflict between old and new money. Weber noticed that newly-rich families were viewed as less than their old money peers. Both groups are wealthy, so how could it be that one was granted a higher status than the other? His answer was political power and prestige. Political power is the ability to influence others and change society. There are a variety of reasons used to justify - "rationalise" - power, such as tradition, legal systems, and emotional influence. Traditions are leveraged by institutions such as churches to maintain their power; rich people lobby politicians to pass laws that protect their wealth, including tax reductions and reduced regulations; and politicians use their personalities and carefully selected words to convince people to follow their will. Each of these rationalisations may be used to maintain power, reinforce their wealth, and therefore elevate their social status. This more divided view of class allows his framework to model reality better than Marx' dialectic. The owner-worker conflict is still useful as a broad theoretical concept, so it is important that both views are presented to students. 

On a smaller scale, a person's role in society grants varying levels of prestige. Doctors are viewed as more prestigious than restaurant waiters due to the requirement of higher education. Bourdieu would later build on this idea of education as a resource used to create social class. He named the concept "social capital", referencing the physical capital that Marx focused on. It is in cases such as this that it becomes clear that there is no perfect theory. Instead, theories are constructed on top of the works of previous writers, fixing their weaknesses and presenting new ideas. Selecting a handful of theories to present as the canonical truth of sociology would be a critical mistake.

Additionally, Bourdieu recognised the tendency for flawed theories to cement themselves in the field of sociology. 
<blockquote>"Sociology is an esoteric science that has all appearances of being exoteric. Therefore modes of producing representations of the world that would be discredited in other scientific domains can survive even in the highest positions in the sociological field as long as they are granted a social authority capable of offsetting their technical, logical, and empirical inadequacies.""</blockquote>[^bourdieu]
In this passage, Bourdieu asserts that the relatively small number of academics scrutinising sociological work allows theories to proliferate without their shortcomings being addressed. If academics in this field uncritically allow tradition to inform what is taught to future students, they will continue to present flawed frameworks as the best sociology can offer.

Overall, it is impossible to condense the whole field of sociology into a set of perfect theories that describe the social world. Instead of attempting to form a canonical sociology, it is best to recognise how different frameworks may be combined to create a clearer view of the social world.
