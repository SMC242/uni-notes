6. To what extent can social science research be unbiased and value-neutral? Justify your answer, focusing on research that uses numerical AND textual data

When conducting research, there is a constant tension between objectivity and the researcher's own perspective. Bias pervades all research. While there are a variety of ways to mitigate bias, this essay will present the case that bias cannot be fully suppressed. 

To begin with, it is worth defining the problem: academic research aims to uncover the truth, yet bias affects the accuracy of research by providing a myopic lens with which to view reality. Producing knowledge that has been implicitly shifted in one direction is harmful, as it is not the truth that it claims to be. Instead, researchers must acknowledge the incompleteness of their works and draw on the works of others to form a more thorough view of reality.

There are a variety of research methods and each method has its own advantages. Each method also grants a view of a particular slice of reality. Macro-level studies such as analysing large government datasets provide an overview of society, yet they do not show everyday experiences. While this is useful for finding trends, closer investigation is required to fully understand a phenomenon. Meso-level methods can be employed to examine particular communities, which can be further investigated through micro-level methods such as interviews. A combination of methods is required in order to build a complete view of the system in question. 

Sampling methods must be also be chosen carefully as they can affect the outcomes of a study. Who is studied is as important as what is studied. For example, the economic conditions in the West of Scotland's Central Belt will be different from the East. One factor may be the collapse of the shipbuilding industry, as that employed many people on the West coast. Beyond questioning who is sampled, it is worthwhile to ask why they were sampled. Researchers must ask themselves why they chose to study a particular population over others, as this can reveal hidden assumptions. An example of such an assumption can be found in many studies focusing on working class areas. It is common for studies of this nature to only examine working-class people and compare them to an idealised middle class. This paints poorer individuals as other and fails to investigate the real differences between socioeconomic conditions.

It is also crucial to acknowledge the position that the researcher occupies in society. Their specific conditions affect what they can see. This is known as standpoint and must be recognised as part of the research. Instead of attempting to see everything, academics should elevate works from marginalised people in order to get a fuller picture of society. Using this framework, the resulting knowledge will be a composition of theories from a variety of standpoints. This should not be mistaken for a lack of bias, as the researcher's biases will still be applied when selecting works to draw upon. Furthermore, the researcher will only be able to access works that have been published. This means that unpublished perspectives will not be part of the pool of research that can be drawn from. Publishing practices must be  questions in order to ensure that all standpoints are published equally.

In conclusion, bias can be reduced with careful study design. Studies can be made more robust by layering macro, meso, and micro-level methodologies in addition to avoiding sampling bias. However, it is impossible to completely eliminate bias, as the author's standpoint will affect their view of reality. Instead, they should build upon the works of others, particularly those who are not granted an equal platform, in order to provide research that views the social world from many angles.
