1. Critically assess the extent to which a specific sociological theory helps us to explain health inequalities.

Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus is a particularly potent analytical tool for understanding the choices an individual is likely to make with regards to their health. Bourdieu's theory can be applied to better understand unbalanced health outcomes between groups.

In *Outline of a theory of practice*, Bourdieu explains habitus as “a subjective but not individual system of internalised structures, schemes of perception, conception, and action common to all members of the same group or class” (Bourdieu, 1977, p.86). He posits that individuals absorb ways of thinking, seeing, and doing from the social structures they experience. Key to this notion is that these impressions are learned and may change as the subject occupies varying forces. They are also not entirely deterministic, an individual can act with their own free will. Habitus merely defines what a person has been taught to do by the structures around them and can. As such, Bourdieu refers to these tendencies as "dispositions". He also introduces the concept of "fields" - social environments where a person's actions are informed by their habitus. That is to say, people adapt to their environment and their habitus influences how they understand their conditions and how they might respond to them.

The way that an individual engages with food is a key factor in assessing their health. "Snack"-type foods such as chocolate, crisps, and biscuits are not nutritionally beneficial, however they are easy to prepare and consume. Meanwhile, discrete hand-prepared meals tend to be more nutritionally balanced because they have to be filling enough to provide energy until the next meal. Therefore, families that enforce regular meals, as opposed to grazing, will instil healthier eating habits in its members. However, cooking meals takes time, skill, and energy. Working class parents may not have the time nor energy to cook. Additionally, underfunded schools will not be able to afford adequate facilities for culinary education, meaning that the skill of cooking must be learned in an individual's own time, which may be spent on work instead. This lack of access to culinary education and time to apply such skills leads to parents opting for nutritionally poor ready-meals. As these meals are not as filling, members of their family will resort to snacking between meals, forming a habit. This cycle is then reproduced as people enter the workforce and are unable to prepare quality meals for their families, explaining the disparity in nutrition between rich and poor families. In other words, snacking becomes part of an individual's habitus.

Substance abuse is another area where Bourdieu's concept of habitus is a useful tool. The boundaries of what activities are deemed acceptable are defined by the individual's surroundings. Family members smoking means access to cigarettes and an environment that enables that behaviour. Smoking then becomes normalised to the individual and they will be more likely to engage in smoking in the future.

A limitation of the theory of habitus is that it works best in homogenous environments. In reality, subjects experience a wide variety of fields that are composed of people from many different backgrounds. Each environment has its own structures at play and will therefore result in different habituses. For example, a person may attend a middle class school but be part of a working class family. They may adopt different habits at school in order to fit into that environment.
