# Questions
## QUESTION 1  
What do archaeologists mean by 'site'?  
Using TWO case studies, discuss the impacts that different definitions of 'site' might have on their protection.  

## QUESTION 2  
What do archaeologists mean by ‘typology’, and what are its advantages and disadvantages?  
Answer using specific examples.

## QUESTION 3  
"...the beast had walked with bent knees and a shambling gait, his head slung forward on a squat neck, his big toe splayed out chimpanzee-like to the side." (Shreeve, 1994: 18). How influential has Marcellin Boule’s description of the skeletal evidence from La Chapelle been to  
our understanding of Neanderthals? What evidence has been used to challenge it?  

## QUESTION 4  
Critically discuss the ways in which archaeological TV Shows have struck a balance between ‘education’ and ‘entertainment’. Use at least TWO examples to support your argument.  

## QUESTION 5  
Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the argument that artefacts and artworks such as the Parthenon Marbles should be returned to their country of origin. Answer using at least  
ONE case study.  

## QUESTION 6  
Select a landscape with which you are familiar and which has strong cultural heritage elements. If you were planning the sustainable management of its heritage, why would you or would you not involve the local community and/or other stakeholders in the process?

# Sites
## Definition
There are a variety of possible definitions

### Archaeological value
- Simplest definition
- Any place that has archaeological artefacts 
	- Potsherds scattered on the ground
	- Postholes
	- Buried walls

### Cultural value
- "significant traces of human activity"
	- What is significance?
	- UNESCO's definition is based on significance
> "World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy." - [UNESCO definition](https://whc.unesco.org/en/faq/19)

[Cultural and national heritage definition](https://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~Sinclair/ALGY399_Site/unesco-heritage.html) from UNESCO

- How do we assign significance?
	- Focus on important people like emperors?
	- Focus on little people like soldiers and their encampments?
	- Focus on everyday people?
		- Caravans who follow soldiers?

See [[arch/Value]]

### Residue
> Sites "... consist essentially of activity areas and rubbish. That is, where people have done things in the past and left some residue of having done something" - Peter Drewett 1999

This is too broad
- What if someone drops litter?
- Obviously unimportant residue
	- Pit-stops on a journey

## Perspectives on sites
### Antiquarian
- Sites are artfacts - objects

### Culture-historial
- Sites that provide a view of a people

### Processualism
- The centre of an area of interconnected systems
- A town is connected to a farm which is connected to its fields
- Trade routes

See [[Processual Archaeology]]

### Modern archaeology
- Focuses on landscapes
	- Whole areas around significant areas
- This means the surroundings can be protected
	- Wind farms, roads, towns, etc shouldn't be put next to sites

## Temporal changes
- Human activities may overlap spatially
- You may choose to mark some parts as sites and not others
- You can say that a site is a palimpsest (something that was once used for one thing, then another thing was done on top of it) 
- When is something old enough to be archaeological?
	- Often defined locally for political reasons
	- New things can still have significance
		- A henge was built in Maryhill, Washington and people were buried there
		- That is significant, but is it archaeological?

## Why does it matter?
Why do we need to define this anyway? Why not decide purely on a case-by-case basis?

- The boundaries of a site must be defined in order for them to be given legal protections
- Conservation
	- Defining how close developments can be
		- Roads
		- Buildings
- Sites are political
	- They are used as part of national identity
	- They may be contested by multiple countries 

### Jerusalem
Case study: Jerusalem, a city claimed by both Israel and Palestine

- Excavations in the Old City, specifically the Burnt House have been used to bolster an image of a valiant defence of the city against the Romans
	- The claim that the house was burnt down during the Roman attack is dubious, as it was not possible to date the ashes so accurately
- These excavations focused on trying to find "alleged evidence of the grand architecture... war, heroism, and destruction, and of the momentous events in Jewish national history" (p.170)
	- They aimed to find dramatic things that could be used to prop up Israeli nationalism
	- The burning could instead be interpreted as fighting within Jerusalem's population rather than Roman attacks, however the latter fits the nationalist narrative better
- Because Israel controls Jerusalem, they get to decide how and what knowledge is produced
	- This means sites and excavation aims are decided by Israeli organisations and thus follow Israeli agendas
	- The Tel Aviv team decided that only the Iron Age era artefacts were worthwhile, discarding everything in between (p.172)

## Protection
What do sites need to be protected from?

- Protection from political conflicts
	- ISIS destroying the Buddha statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan
- Protection from erosion
	- Tourism
	- Maintenance to fix natural erosion
- Protection from archaeologists
	- Excavation is destructive
		- It yields a better understanding of the site
		- Cannot be undone
		- Some tests damage artefacts (Seahenge's tree trunk)
	- Relevant communities may disapprove of disturbing the site
	- Moving parts of a site to a museum
		- The artefacts will be better preserved
		- However, they are taken out of their context
		- Efforts can be made to reconstruct their context in the museum

## Who owns protected sites?
The authority that gets to designate sites will have its own beliefs. This can result in differing decisions on what counts as a site and how it is preserved

- Governments
	- Have political agendas
- Local communities
	- May not have the resources to protect the sites
- The archaeological community
	- Might tunnel-vision on research outcomes and not value the opinions of those outwith the field (see Seahenge)
	- They don't have the authority or money on their own; funding must come from somewhere
	- Private funding may have agendas which influence decisions
- International organisations
	- Independent
	- It is difficult to get countries to agree to external control
	- Even once agreed, this must be respected by *all* current and future administrations (see Bamiyan statues)
	- UNESCO is an example of this

## Preservation
An example of landscape-based site designation and the resulting preservation

Case study: Stonehenge
- Stonehenge is surrounded by many artefacts for miles
- Only the circle and the hypothesised approach path are legally protected
	- The full area would be too large to designate as protected (residue-based approach)
	- A landscape-based approach was used
- The visitor shop was moved away from the circle, behind a hill, to restore the landscape 
- Traffic on a nearby main road was disallowed and now is only for transporting visitors
- The surrounding area was deforested
	- This means that the area isn't as it was, even with these changes
	- However, it is nicer with less noise from the road
- You could argue that the road is now part of the landscape now

# Repatriation
## Context
- Artefacts must be protected from museum visitors in order to preserve them
- This removes them from their context
	- The context is key for understanding an artefact
	- A jar is just a jar. A jar found in a burial site tells a different story

Solutions:
- Replicas (to allow touch)
- Dioramas 
- Music and sound effects (to set the scene)

## Neutrality
- Museums have agendas
	- This is informed by the surrounding culture
	- Influenced by trying to appeal to a wider audience (may not show controversial things)
- They have to select what they show
	- How do they assign value?
- Their opinions of what is acceptable to display are political

## Colonial roots
- Many artefacts were stolen
	- Sold
		- May be sold by families suffering from colonial oppression
	- Displayed in museums
- Artefacts have been destroyed as a means of repressing a culture
- Artefacts moved to capital cities are still being taken from their homes
- The thief may have had legal permission at the time
- Colonialism is still ongoing
	- Continuing to hold stolen artefacts is part of this
	- Reparations should be made

## Ownership
- Artefacts can only be in one place at a time
- They can be digitally recreated as a stand-in
- Countries can simply refuse to return artefacts and there is little the victim country can do
- Multiple countries may lay claim to the artefact as part of their culture

## Parthenon marbles
- Marble sculptures from the Parthenon in Greece (a temple)
- These sculptures were removed from the temple in the 19th century by a British ambassador [source](https://www.britishmuseum.org/about-us/british-museum-story/contested-objects-collection/parthenon-sculptures)
- Many are in London, the rest are in Greece
- Some sculptures have been split into pieces and separated between countries

### For
- The display of these artefacts in Britain helped to develop British culture
	- Key to the development of Western art
	- It is now part of British history
- "The past belongs to everyone"
	- The British Museum is meant to be a world heritage museum
- They're scared of returning more artefacts
- It was made illegal to return them

### Against
- Taken from their homes
- Sculptures have been split up
- You can no longer experience the Parthenon as it was
- Important representation of Ancient Greek art
