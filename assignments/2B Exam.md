# Theories
## Theory
[[Pierre Bourdieu#Habitus|Habitus]]
- Your upbringing defines your future habits
- Seeing things be acceptable as a child informs what you feel comfortable doing as an adult

### Theoretical explanantion
- Individuals experience objective social structures 
- These structures instil certain ways to thinking and behaving
	- Class becomes embedded in every aspect of a person's ways of behaving
	- E.G using cutlery, walking, the clothes you wear, the foods you eat

## Risk factors
- [[Obesity]]
- Access 
- Drug use 
	- Alcoholism
	- Smoking
	- Illegal drugs (heroin, meth)

## Eating habits
- The practices for consuming food while growing up will continue to affect a person's relationship with food
- Discrete meals tend to be more nutritionally balanced
	- This is because they have to be filling enough to keep you going between meals
- Foods that are quick and easy tend to be less nutritionally balanced
	- Chocolate, biscuits, crisps
- If a person's family encouraged them to eat mainly at mealtimes, they will continue to avoid snacking
- This means consuming a generally better diet
- However, in order to provide this, the family must have time to prepare these meals
- A poorer family will not have as much time to cook or learn the necessary skills to cook
- Therefore, they will resort to ready-meals which are not as healthy

## Choices in food
- The variety of food experienced when growing up informs what you will like as an adult
- If you experience poor quality food, you will tend to like those foods --> eating unhealthily
- Poor quality food is cheaper --> less wealthy families will be less healthy --> will choose less healthy foods in the future

## Exposure to substances
- Habitus also informs what an individual sees as acceptable
- Watching their family members and peers smoke will make them more likely to smoke
- This makes them more likely to pick up substance abuse habits
- In the case of smoking, second-hand smoke may push non-smokers to interact less with smokers, which reinforces their habit

## Gangs
- [Key text](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854819871076?casa_token=D2QMDtCCiOoAAAAA:BvPeUbi6CbXs1QFqOIb-vkayqaHKCJzg-Ck_9ZYM04ZGUmbQznWlTXbfaLw8AxGAbxyP4XhyiZNd)

## Limitations
- [Starting point](https://socialtheoryapplied.com/2016/04/11/social-class-place-limits-habitus/)
	- Habitus assumes communities are homogenous
	- In heterogenous communities, young people mix with a variety of people from different backgrounds
		- Their family may be working class, but their peers at school and clubs may be middle class
	- This leads to a collection of habituses instead of one
		- Each habitus is used in a different context
- [Paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bonikowski/files/bonikowski_-_the_promise_of_bourdieusian_political_sociology_1.pdf)
- [Critique](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4128669?saml_data=eyJzYW1sVG9rZW4iOiIxYWVkMDA4ZS03MDk0LTQyZmMtYmFlMC0wZTM5OTRhMzI4NjQiLCJpbnN0aXR1dGlvbklkcyI6WyI0NmEwOWQ4Yi0wZmY2LTQ3OTEtOTA3MS0zZWViNWY5ZmFhNTciXX0)
- Habitus puts a lot of emphasis on childhood
	- Bourdieu does acknowledge that it can change over time
	- 

# Objectivity
- Draw on [[Michel Foucault]]

## Research methods
- Research methods affect outcomes of research
- Macro-level studies like analysing big datasets won't reveal everyday experiences
- Meso-level studies reveal things about a single community. The findings might not map onto other communities
- Micro-level studies like interviews won't show the structures at play

## Standpoint
- A person's understanding of the world is influenced why who they are
	- This means that you cannot create neutral research
- Men benefiting from the patriarchy may find that its effects are invisible, while women can clearly see it
- Women being excluded from production meant that they were invisible to older economic theories
	- These theories are still relevant, but must be combined with an intersectional analysis

## The best you can do
- Combine methods
	- Use a combination of macro, meso, and micro-level methods
- Recognise subjective experiences as important
	- Do not assume that your experience is universal
- Acknowledge your standpoint
	- Who you are influences your research
	- Draw on research from a variety of standpoints to support your own research
	- Pitfall: the supporting research chosen will be biased by your standpoint (where you choose to look, who you choose to listen to)
