# Questions
## Question 1
What ethical considerations should archaeologists take into consideration when dealing with unprovenanced artefacts? To what extent would you consider an unprovenanced artefact’s meaning to have been lost? Your answer must draw on AT LEAST ONE archaeological case study.

### Hints
It helps here to remember the lecture and tutorial on ‘Material Culture’, and the lectures on ‘From Excavation to Interpretation’ and ‘Archaeology and Preservation’. There are multiple dimensions to this question that you may choose to develop. Think carefully about how controlled excavation and finds recording/processing seeks to establish meaning, and what is lost when this chain is broken/circumvented (e.g. looting). You might also think about the journey of the artefact(s) from the ground to the collection (public or private), the communities and stakeholders affected, and the impacts of academic intervention.  

The artefact(s) you choose to examine in this essay may be drawn from the suggested readings or may come from your own wider reading - if you know of a good example, use it! It may also help to examine news articles, blogs, or other online sources for this essay in addition to published journal articles or books, but make sure to check the integrity of the source. If uncertain, ask your tutorial leader.

## Question 2
“He should not be here, he should be back in the bog”. Evaluate the arguments for and against the display of ‘bog bodies’ to the public using TWO case studies.

### Hints
This quote is attributed to Emma Restell Orr at the opening night of the exhibition ‘Lindow Man:: A Bog Mystery’ at Manchester Museum in 2008 (Giles 2020: 251). Restell Orr is a modern pagan and founder of the group ‘Honouring the Ancient Dead’ (HAD), one of various communities and stakeholders with strong views either for or against the display of human remains in museum contexts. These discussions are heightened when it comes to ‘bog bodies’, due to their remarkable preservation and unique public appeal. Some museums have taken these ethical considerations on board when designing their displays. It may be useful to consider what decisions curators have made in their display of specific ‘bog bodies’, and how effective you consider these to have been.  

The key thing here is to engage with the various arguments, in spite of the emotive language that is sometimes used. A good way of ‘evaluating’ an argument is to draw up both the strengths and the weaknesses. You might well bring your own values to the discussion. This is fine, but it’s worth reflecting on what’s making you argue for a particular position. The suggested readings are a starting point, but remember that to evaluate a range of positions in this debate requires engaging with diverse perspectives and reflecting critically on your selection of sources.

# Research
## What are bog bodies?
- Bodies preserved in peat
- This mummifies the body (protects it from degradation)
	- Skin and organs survive
	- The bones break down
	- Clothing decomposes
- This level of preservation is rare and gives an insight into the circumstances of the person's death
	- It also means that the skin can be examined for things such as scars
- Mainly found in Northern Europe
- Many bodies indicate that they were killed and put in a bog for a reason; they did not die there by accident
	- Additionally, they may have been killed elsewhere and deposited in the bog
	- Iron age bodies were found with trinkets, indicating religious human sacrifice
	- Forked sticks were sometimes used to hold the body in place

# Possible points
## Facts about bog bodies
See [[#What are bog bodies?]]

## Importance to the field
- They have revealed the potential importance of bogs to Iron Age societies
- They make reconstructions very easy
- Organs can be analysed
	- Stomach contents (last meals)
	- Nails (quality of diet, beauty habits)

## Graubelle man
- Talk about what happened to him
- Evaluate morality of the procedures

- Corpse was displayed for 10 days
	- Many visitors were respectful, taking off their hats and treating him with reverence 
- He was then X-rayed, autopsied, and preserved
- An entire body has never been preserved before
	- A method was developed specifically for him
	- Instead of drying out the body, the body was soaked in oak water to finish tanning him (making his skin leathery) and treated with oils (Turkish Red Oil) to keep it moist [^overview]
	- The body was stuffed with oak bark [^stuffing]
	- Drying out the body would cause shrinkage, which would damage the body
- The autopsy was controversial because it caused irreparable damage to the body
- CT scans were done and a 3D model was generated of his face [^overview]

## Respecting the dead
- Is it respectful to display somebody's corpse?
	- Who gets to decide that?
		- The society that the museum exists in?
		- The society the person lived in?
		- If the body was moved from its resting place, should that place's customs be used instead of the museum's local customs?
	- Where is it okay to display?
		- In the region the body was found?
		- In the country it was found?
		- Anywhere?
	- How should it be displayed?
		- In a display case?
		- Not at all?
		- Temporarily?
	- What scientific procedures should be allowed?
		- Non-destructive only? (E.G no autopsies, scans okay)

## Canada's view
- In Canadian museums, remains of people are not displayed because the native peoples would be offended [^museums]
- In other words: their take on "who gets to decide?" is the modern culture of the person
- Museums often meet with indigenous groups in order to make sure that their exhibits are respectful
- An exhibit of a bog body went ahead and saw a lot of backlash
	- It was seen as disrespectful to display the dead
	- Merchandise containing images of the bog people was sold - not just of the reconstructions but also the corpse
	- The majority of the backlash related to the merchandise, not displaying the bodies
- Despite the backlash, the exhibition was not pulled

## Comments collected in German museums
- A comments box is regularly sampled in a Germany museum containing multiple bog bodies [^museums]
- “I think it is good that the bog bodies are here, since death is a natural and proper part of life.”
- "I find that the bodies are reverently exhibited – not sensationalistically. The dark atmosphere and the manner in which the corpse is covered with the peat is very dignified..."
- The majority of responses were positive
	- Note that the sample size is only 246 children and 72 adults
	- It is too small to draw conclusions about the wider German population - particularly the adult sample
	- Additionally, the kind of person that is likely to attend a museum is someone with free time (I.E wealthier people) so it represents mostly middle to upper class people
	- Additionally, dissenters may avoid the museum and therefore won't be represented in this sample
