# Questions
## Health
1. What do sociological theories offer for our understanding of causes of  
socioeconomic health inequalities?
2. Answer ONE of the following::  
	a) Eat less, exercise more. Why does sociology add to the prescription for rising obesity?  
	b) Is more economic development required to improve population health? Discuss with reference to relevant sociological evidence.  
	c) Why do Scots die younger than in other comparable populations? Discuss with reference to relevant sociological evidence.  
	d) Why did life expectancy stop improving before the COVID-19 pandemic? Discuss with reference to relevant sociological evidence.

## Gender and ethnicity
3. Explain the notion of the ‘naturalization’ of social relations and how it illuminates the connection between sexism and racism.
4. What is the role of gender in anti-immigration ideologies? Answer by referring to the current process of the ‘nationalising of gender equality’ (Meret and Siim 2013: 83) in right-wing nationalist discourses in Western Europe.

## Research skills
5. “The research methods academics use, determine whether they give the right or wrong answer.” Discuss with reference to at least two of the following: ethics, measurement and analysis.
6. “Each society has its regime of truth, its ‘general politics’ of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements; the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true” (Foucault, 1980: 131). Discuss, by drawing on approaches to researching with numeric and discursive data: how do researchers demonstrate rigour in their work?
7. How and in what ways does standpoint offer a critique to ‘malestream’   knowledge? Discuss, by drawing on feminist approaches to researching the everyday.

# Chosen question
3. Explain the notion of the ‘naturalization’ of social relations and how it illuminates the connection between sexism and racism.

# Knowledge map
- Gender is not natural
	- We created it 
	- Women are not naturally suited for domestic labour and men aren't better at "rational roles"
	- Draw on Judith Butler?
- Race is not natural either
	- There is more genetic diversity within Africans than between Africans and any other region on the planet
	- Yet racialised peoples are seen as better for domestic labour
![[Division of Labour#Employment]]
- Avoid the concept of race, use ethnicity (**Get a better understanding of ethnicity**)
- Over time, racist and patriarchal ways of organising society have become traditional ("how things have always been done"). This is justified by saying that "they're just better at that stuff"
	- 
	- Can also be used to support stigma (see African-American people being painted as violent)
- The police are used to reinforce this relationship via the prison-industrial complex
	- Stigmatized groups start to be seen as more likely to be criminals
	- Then it becomes naturalised by the media that they are violent
- Women are taken less seriously in the workplace
	- They are less likely to be promoted
	- Men tend to occupy client-facing roles while women work behind the scenes ("clerical work")
- Naturalisation is the common thread between racism and sexism
	- See Anthias 1998, 2001
	- Ethnicity and sex only exist within these hierarchies
	- They become real via naturalisation
- Black families can serve as a shelter from the racist society surrounding them
	- However, this shelter still contains patriarchy
- Rich white women buy their way out of oppression to some degree by getting racialised women to work for them
	- Black slaves have simply been replaced by migrant workers
	- This creates a flow of workers from the Global South to the Global North, leaving families behind to be cared for by the remaining women
- Orientalism has painted:
	- Asian women as seductive and mysterious --> fetishised
	- Asian men as sexually impotent, but useful in STEM fields --> their works on STEM projects are exploited by white men like Elon Musk

# Points
## Gender is constructed
- Draw on Judith Butler
- Gender is something that is experienced and performed; It is external to the self and changes over time and space
- It is not natural, but learned, as demonstrated by trans people

## Race was a tool of colonial projects
- The notion of race has been used to justify colonial projects
- It creates a boundary between the coloniser and colonised, allow characteristics to be assigned to each
	- The civilised coloniser bringing law, technology, and order to primitive, violent natives

## On naturalisation
- Read Anthias 1998, 2001

## Racism in white feminism
- White feminists look at women of other ethnic groups and apply their experiences and perspectives to them instead of listening
- This leads to white feminists telling other cultures what they should and shouldn't do
	- They may use their power to force change from the outside, enacting ignorant policies
	- Look at studies about burqas/hijabs
- Instead, white feminists must platform women of other ethnicities and learn from them
- [Key text](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/stable/pdf/1395006.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A4e844ca8073ef1d0d95d01d25fbcc1c8&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1)

## Division of labour
- Women do much more domestic labour
- Racialised women tend to do unstable, dangerous, and low-paid domestic labour work for white women
	- These women are seen as better at it
- Care drain
- Buying out of oppression
- Look at studies on job security and pay for migrant women

## Women in the workplace
- Women usually do clerical jobs, while men do client-focused, technical, or dangerous work
- Women aren't taken seriously
	- Not promoted
- Draw on "are you a black person or a woman first" study

## Portrayals of racialised people
- Fetishism of Asian women
	- Mysterious
	- Sensual
	- Young, childish even
- Sexual impotence of Asian men, yet treated as smarter in STEM fields
	- Credit for their work is taken by white men
- Hypersexuality and violence of African men (link forward to prison-industrial complex)
- Masculinity of African women
	- Due to the notion of hypersexual African men, African women are seen as similarly sexual
- - Feminisation/hypermasculinisation of racialised men: Sinha 1995, Siim and Meret 2013
- Sexualisation/masculinisation of racialised women: Hill Collins 1990, McClintock 1995


## Effects of the Prison-industrial complex
- African-American men are fed into prisons in a loop
	- This leaves the women in their families to pick up the slack
- Due to women's role as carers for children, they are penalised more severely for drug crimes as drug usage leads to neglect and problems with pregnancies
- Notion of welfare-dependent single black mothers being a drain on government resources
- Single mothers are pushed into the workforce instead of being supported, leading to neglect of their children
- Women caught taking drugs while pregnant are coerced into taking long-term contraceptives to prevent them from having more children
	- This takes away their reproductive autonomy
	- The contraceptives also have side-effects that can make everyday life difficult

# Research
## Quotes
> "Race and sex are social realities which at particular historical moments  structure class relations in as much as class relations structure them"
>- (Lewis and Parmar, 1983).

> “**There is nothing less natural than the groups in question, which precisely are constituted by a precise type of relationship**: **the relationship of power**, a relationship which makes them into things (both destined to be things and mechanically oriented to be such), but which makes them, since they only exist as things within this relationship. This is the relationship in which they are involved (slavery, marriage, migrant labour) and which makes them such at every moment. Outside of these relations they don’t exist; they cannot even be imagined. **They are not given of nature, but naturalised givens of social relationships**” 
> - (Guillaumin, Colette, _Racism, Sexism, Power and Ideology_, Taylor & Francis Group, 1995:150).
