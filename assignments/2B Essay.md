# Questions
## Health
1. What do sociological theories offer for our understanding of causes of  
socioeconomic health inequalities?
2. Answer ONE of the following::

	c) Why do Scots die younger than in other comparable populations? Discuss with reference to relevant sociological evidence.  
	d) Why did life expectancy stop improving before the COVID-19 pandemic? Discuss with reference to relevant sociological evidence.

## Gender and ethnicity
3. Explain the notion of the ‘naturalization’ of social relations and how it illuminates the connection between sexism and racism.
4. What is the role of gender in anti-immigration ideologies? Answer by referring to the current process of the ‘nationalising of gender equality’ (Meret and Siim 2013: 83) in right-wing nationalist discourses in Western Europe.

## Research skills
5. “The research methods academics use, determine whether they give the right or wrong answer.” Discuss with reference to at least two of the following: ethics, measurement and analysis.
6. “Each society has its regime of truth, its ‘general politics’ of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements; the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true” (Foucault, 1980: 131). Discuss, by drawing on approaches to researching with numeric and discursive data: how do researchers demonstrate rigour in their work?
7. How and in what ways does standpoint offer a critique to ‘malestream’   knowledge? Discuss, by drawing on feminist approaches to researching the everyday.

# Knowledge map
- Gender is not natural
	- We created it 
	- Women are not naturally suited for domestic labour and men aren't better at "rational roles"
- Race is not natural either
	- There is more genetic diversity within Africans than between Africans and any other region on the planet
	- Yet racialised peoples are seen as better for domestic labour
![[Division of Labour#Employment]]
- Avoid the concept of race, use ethnicity (**Get a better understanding of ethnicity**)
- Over time, racist and patriarchal ways of organising society have become traditional ("how things have always been done"). This is justified by saying that "they're just better at that stuff"
	- Can also be used to support stigma (see African-American people being painted as violent)
- The police are used to reinforce this relationship via the prison-industrial complex
	- Stigmatized groups start to be seen as more likely to be criminals
	- Then it becomes naturalised by the media that they are violent
- Naturalisation is the common thread between racism and sexism
	- See Anthias 1998, 2001
> -   “**There is nothing less natural than the groups in question, which precisely are constituted by a precise type of relationship**: **the relationship of power**, a relationship which makes them into things (both destined to be things and mechanically oriented to be such), but which makes them, since they only exist as things within this relationship. This is the relationship in which they are involved (slavery, marriage, migrant labour) and which makes them such at every moment. Outside of these relations they don’t exist; they cannot even be imagined. **They are not given of nature, but naturalised givens of social relationships**” (Guillaumin, Colette, _Racism, Sexism, Power and Ideology_, Taylor & Francis Group, 1995:150).
	- Ethnicity and sex only exist within these hierarchies
	- They become real via naturalisation
