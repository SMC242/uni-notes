# Possible points
## What is the abolition movement?
- Roots in slavery abolition movement
- Aim to tear down the carceral system
- Takes a humanist approach to criminality:: criminality is the result of a person's conditions. Few people turn to crime without reason
- View the prison system as deeply flawed
	- It is a system for disadvantaging marginalised peoples
	- It locks them in a cycle of poverty
	- It does not prevent crime
	- It subjects people within the prison to abuse
	- It punishes rather than reforms --> leads to recidivism 
	- Exploits inmates for cheap labour
- Wants to replace the carceral system with systems that::
	- Repair the damage done
	- Support the victims in their recovery
	- Educate and support the offender to avoid them doing further harm
	- Foster programmes that reduce crime via education, therapy, and community development
	- Are community-led, so each community can tailor their policies to their specific needs

> \[Prison abolitionists aim for\] Not so much the abolition of prisons, but the abolition of a society that could have prisons

[History](https:://oxfordre.com/criminology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-625#acrefore-9780190264079-e-625-div1-1)

## Roots of the prison system
The roots of the prison system are in retribution, now we attempt to correct
- Invoke [[Michel Foucault]] to explain how prisons punish the soul
- Prisons in America developed due to slavery
![[Michel Foucault#Why do we punish?]]
Abolitionists contest that prisons are good at correction. Instead, prisons are effective at punishing the soul of the inmate

## Do prisons reduce crime?
Another reason we employ prisons is to give the illusion of protection from criminals. 
- Prisons only protect the community from criminals while they are incarcerated
	- Repeat offending is common because incarceration doesn't help the individual to reintegrate into society
	- [Incarceration makes recidivism more likely](https:://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/1477370809341128)
- Inmates are subjected to massive violence
	- Abolitionists recognise that inmates are people too and therefore can be victimised within prisons
	- Link back to [[Michel Foucault]]:: allowing this violence punishes the body and soul, instead of preventing future crimes

## Prison industrial complex
Under capitalism, prisons provide a cheap labour force that can be made to produce goods. These goods are then sold for a larger profit than would be possible with free citizens due to better worker's rights

- Creates a modern slavery
	- Links back to the roots of prisons

[Davis, 2000](https:://www.jstor.org/stable/40338793)

- Profit motive to maintain prison populations
	- Even in countries where prisons are not private, this motivation can be cloaked with "prisoners contributing back to the economy"
- Capitalism has a pressure for constant growth, leading to pressure to grow the prison population

See:: [[Prison-industrial complex]]

Link:: and how do they maintain/grow population? -->

## Discrimination
Minorities are demonised by the media which gives the police an excuse to disproportionately police areas where those groups live. This feeds the prisons
- Any understanding of the prison system is incomplete without analysing how race, sexuality, and gender play into it
	- Racialised people are painted as violent
	- Queer people are painted as sexual predators
	- Women face lots of intimate partner violence
- The prison system does not exist in a vacuum
	- The media demonises groups
	- The police then crack down on those groups
	- Politicians seek approval by "cracking down on crime" without solving the root causes
- "Revolving door" of prison sentences

## Sanctions
### Current punishments
[Effectiveness of restorative justice](https:://restorativejustice.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/files/An%20International%20Review%20of%20Restorative%20Justice.pdf)
- What does community service actually achieve?
	- Often unpaid labour
	- Often doesn't affect the victims but some random aspect of the community
		- *Paying back* to the wrong people
- Most crimes are not serious
- Serious crimes are currently not handled
	- ==Data needed==

### Alternatives
[Reparative and restorative approaches p162-195](https:://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/gla/reader.action?docID=449550)
- Preventing recitivism via community panels
	- Gathering members to see what action could be taken to avoid the offender going back to prison
- Victim-offender mediation
	- Helps with empathy
	- Limitation:: only used for less severe crimes so far
		- Evidence that it might be 
- Community surveillance
