# Overview

This is for the Professional Skills and Issues exam

# Legal

## Elements of crime

- Actus Reus: the illegal action/omission
  - Includes words but not thoughs
- Mens Rea: the intention
  - Some crimes have strict liability (only the actus reus matters)

## Computer misuse act

AKA CMA

- S1: unauthorised computer access
  - Criminal must know it is unauthorised access and intend to do it
- S2: unauthorised access with intent to commit other crimes
- S3: unauthorised acts with intention to impair the operation of a computer (includes recklessness)
  - [[Denial of Service]] attacks
  - 3A is an amendment for creating hacking tools
    - Must be created to do bad
  - 3ZA is an amendment for damage to human welfare
    - Used for people targeting infrastructure
- The targeted institution/company must have acceptible use policies
- People must be aware of CMA

## Data protection act 2018

AKA DPA 2018

- S144: intentionally or recklessly making incorrect statements in response to information notices
- S170:
  - You can't obtain/disclose personal data without permission from the data controller
  - Take the personal data of another person without the consent of the person
  - Retain the data without permission from the controller (at the time it was obtained)
- Places responsibility on the companies to prove compliance
  - Data breaches must be reported within 72 hours
- Staff can't be prosecuted unless authorisation is clear

## General data protection regulation

AKA GDPR

Key terms:

- Personal data (PD): data about a data subject
- Data subject: a living, identifiable person
  - Doesn't apply to anonymous info or dead people
- Processing: how PD is handled
- Data controller (DC): organisation that holds data

- UK uses a variant of it called UK GDPR

  - Age of child consent is 13 instead of 16
  - Changes regulations about handling of criminal PD (personal data)
  - How PD can be used for automated decision making

- Places responsibility on the companies to prove compliance
- Examples of PD:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Phone number
  - Email address
  - Bank account number
  - National insurance number
  - Library card
- General rule: it's PD if it's info about a person or can be used to identify them if combined with other info. Examples of the latter:
  - IP addresses
  - Usernames
  - Logs of physical locations
  - Fingerprints
  - CCTV footage
  - GPS location
- Data where identifiers have been removed is still PD
- Certain types of data (known as sensitive PD) have extra protections because they could be used to discriminate. You need explicit permission or a very good reason to collect this
  - Race
  - Ethnic background
  - Sexual orientation and sex life
  - Religious beliefs
  - Political opinions
  - Union membership
  - Health data
  - Biometrics
  - Genetic info
- 7 principles:
  1. Process lawfully, fairly, transparently (consent, vital interests, public interest, legitimate reason)
  2. Processed only for specified, explicit, and legitimate reasons
  3. Adequate, relevant, and only what is necessary (collect minimal data)
  4. Accurate and kept up-to-date
  5. Not kept for longer than necessary (DC must have time limits for storage of PD)
  6. Store PD securely. Encrypt the data
  7. DCs must be accountable. Keep detailed records as evidence of compliance. Third parties must also do this
- DCs are "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data"
  - The decision makers of data processing
  - Individuals processing PD for household activity are not considered
- Data processors are "a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller"

  - Bodies that act on behalf of and under the data controller
  - Can make day-to-day decisions but should only follow the DC's instructions for processing the PD

  - If they act without the DC's instructions, they become the controller for that activity --> same liability

- Defines some data access rights:
  - To be informed of how PD is used (privacy notices)
    - DC is responsible for this
  - Access to your own personal data (via subject access requests)
    - Must ask in writing
    - Must be provided within a month
    - Must be free
    - Easy to access and understand
    - Can take up to 3 months with a small processing fee but the DC must say why within a month
  - Rectify inaccurate PD
  - Erase PD ("right to be forgotten")
  - Restrict processing of PD before it is verified or corrected
  - Data portability (receive copies of data in a machine-readable format)
    - Must be in a structured, common format (CSV, XML, JSON)
    - Can ask to send to another DC
    - Only raw data is given. Inferred data doesn't have to be given
  - Shouldn't be subject to automated decision making (profiling, direct marketing, for research without public interest)
    - Explicit consent or legal authorisation must be given
    - If sensitive data required, explicit consent or public interest required
    - DC should tell you the details of profiling and automated decision making, including data sources (not obligated)
    - DC must explain how to access the data used to create your profile and make it simple to request human intervention or challenge decisions
  - Object to how your PD is being used
  - Response should be received within a month
- Breaches leading to disclosure, loss, destruction or alteration of PD that presents a serious risk to rights and freedoms must be reported to the ICO within 72 hours
  - The data subject must be notified ASAP

## Online safety act 2023

AKA OSA 2023

- Duties for social media companies and search services to protect users (particularly children)
  - Preventing children from accessing harmful/age inappropriate content
    - Parents and children must be able to report problems
  - Reduce risks of illegal activity on their platform and remove it when found
  - Platforms must be transparent about the types of harmful content they allow and abilities to avoid seeing it
    - E.G blurring images on Google when Safe Search is enabled
- Offenses:
  - Encouraging or assisting self-harm
  - Cyberflashing (think of flashers on Omegle)
  - Spreading misinformation with the intent to cause harm (cyberbullying)
  - Threatening communications
  - Intimate image abuse (revenge porn)
  - Epilepsy trolling
- Protections:
  - Take action against illegal content/activity (CSA, fraud, drug trade, fraud)
  - Take action against content that is harmful to children (porn, self-harm, eating disorders)
  - Enforce age limits
  - Give adults tools to filter content
  - Quickly remove suicide/self-harm content
- Larger platforms are expected to take greater action
- Users' rights must be taken into account when OFCOM is planning action. Platforms have to take users' actions into account too when fulfilling safety duties
- OFCOM compliance duties:
  - Prevent users from encountering illegal content
  - Manage risk of illegal activity
  - Age verification
  - Do risk assessments
  - Remove illegal content
  - Protect children from harmful content
  - Explain the terms of service

Pros

- Child protection - enforces age checking measures to prevent children from
  accessing age-inappropriate content on social media platforms.
- Content removal - requires tech companies to promptly remove illegal content like
  child sexual abuse material, hate speech, and content promoting self-harm.
- User control - allows users to filter out unwanted content like online abuse and
  customize their online experience.
- Transparency and risk assessment - forces large platforms to publish risk
  assessments outlining potential dangers to users, particularly children.
- Accountability for platforms - holds tech companies responsible for enforcing
  their own terms of service and taking action against harmful content.
- Improved reporting mechanisms - provides clear pathways for users to report
  harmful content and concerns.
- Enforcement by Ofcom - grants the communications regulator Ofcom with power
  to investigate and sanction companies that fail to comply with online safety rules.

Cons

- Over-reach on content moderation - could force platforms to remove too much content,
  potentially impacting legitimate discussions and viewpoints, due to broad definition of
  "harmful content" / not removing enough content, or doing it quickly enough
- Privacy concerns - requirement for platforms to scan private messages to detect illegal
  content with fears of government surveillance
- Free speech implications - could stifle free speech by causing platforms to err on the side
  of caution and remove content that may be controversial but not necessarily illegal
- Enforcement challenges - how effectively the Act can be enforced, particularly with regards
  to identifying and removing harmful content across a wide range of platforms
- Potential for abuse - could be used to target specific groups or viewpoints, leading to
  censorship
- Lack of focus on system design - focuses on content removal and not enough on proactive
  measures to prevent harmful content from appearing in the first place
- Unclear definitions - some provisions in the Act lack clear definitions, which could lead to
  inconsistent application and interpretation

# Ethics

## Ethics vs values

Ethics:

- Moral principles and guidelines
  - How people should act

Values:

- What individuals see as important
- Influenced by ethics

Schwartz's ten basic values are:

- **Self-Direction**: Independent thought and action, emphasizing creativity, freedom, and curiosity.
- **Stimulation**: Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life through adventure and new experiences.
- **Hedonism**: Pleasure and enjoyment of life through indulgence and gratification.
- **Achievement**: Personal success demonstrated through competence, ambition, and recognition.
- **Power**: Control or dominance over people and resources, valuing authority and influence.
- **Security**: Safety, stability, and harmony in society, relationships, and self.
- **Conformity**: Adherence to norms, rules, and expectations to maintain social order and avoid upsetting others.
- **Tradition**: Respect, commitment, and acceptance of cultural or religious customs and ideas.
- **Benevolence**: Concern for the well-being of others in close relationships, emphasizing kindness and loyalty.
- **Universalism**: Understanding, tolerance, and protection of all people and nature, fostering equality and social justice.

## Moral realism vs subjectivism vs relativism

- Realism: moral principles have an objective basis
- Subjectivism: moral principles are based on personal experience and opinion
- Relativism: moral standards are based on social approval
  - Varies between individuals within a society and between societies
  - Changes with time

### Relativism

- There are no objective moral facts
  - Moral judgements are just a statement of the speaker's feelings
- Descriptive relativists focus on describing different cultures' and peoples' moral stances
  - Something can be right/wrong within a society
- Normative relativists say that there is no factual basis for morality --> no moral stances are right/wrong

### Cultural relativism

- Differing local views and laws indicate that there is no central right/wrong
- It can be argued that some values are common across most if not all cultures

### Consequentialism

- The action that will lead to the best outcome is the morally correct one
- Morality of an action depends on the results of the action exclusively
- More goodness is better
- Examples:
  - Utilitarianism (maximise human welfare or well-being)
  - Ethical altruism (maximise welfare of others)
  - Hedonism (maximise pleasure/contentment)
- You can't always know the consequences of an action
- Logical conclusion: no actions are inherently wrong

#### Act consequentialism

- Essentially vanilla consequentialism - each action is evaluated independently

#### Rule consequentialism

- Some general rules can be derived from the typical consequences (called rule consequentialism)
  - Murder is wrong because people die and we need people to make society run
- Rules are adopted by more people are the ones that produce the best results

### Deontology

- AKA duty-based ethics
- What people do, not the consequences
  - Do the right thing because it's the right thing to do
  - Don't do wrong things because they're wrong
- Built on a notion of inherent rightness/wrongness
- Moral rules are universal

#### Virtue ethics

- Based on the notion of a "virtuous person" that everyone should aspire to be
  - Person-based rather than action-based
- Examples of virtues:
  - Justice
  - Fidelity
  - Honesty
  - Prudence

## Routine ethics

- CS problems are similar to other fields and should be treated the same
- Wrong: CS has a global impact and moves far faster than legal bodies
  - Logical malleability: can solve most problems
  - Invisible: most programs are black boxes. 3 types of abuse:
    - Invisible abuse: intentionally abusing the black box to do unethical things
    - Invisible programming: unintentional or intentional biases in the program
    - Invisible complex calculation: complex algorithms are used to obscure the reasons for decisions (E.G systematically declining health insurance for profit)
  - Informationally enriching: computing changes a field ("informationalises" the field)
    - Information processing becomes part of the field (E.G betting on football games)

# Professionalism

- Professional societies: BCS, ACM, IEEE

## Definition

- Mastery of a body of knowledge (usually via higher education)
