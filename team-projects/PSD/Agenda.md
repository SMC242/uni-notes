# Questions about requirements
- When one person finishes a stage, should they have to wait for the other reviewers to finish the stage before progressing?
	- Pro: prevents redundant work in later stages
	- Con: blocks reviewers
	- Suggestion: let users review files that they have already voted yes on, but if the other reviewers vote no, the file gets dragged back to the previous stage
	- Pending state
- Should the minimum number of core reviewer votes be configurable or automatic?
	- Useful for single-reviewer projects (I.E personal use) 
- What are the requirements for auditing the review process?
	- A searchable timeline of all actions that occurred?
