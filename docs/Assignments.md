# Purpose
- Tracking what assignments are due into an overview page
- Making it easy to jump to details on a given assignment

# Usage
Create a note in `assignments/` with the following keys in the metadata:
- `class`: the name of the class
- `deadline`: the date it's due
- `difficulty`: how tiring the assignment will be to work on
	- May be _Easy/Medium/Hard_
- `time`: an estimate of how much time it will take to complete
	- May be _Day/Few days/Week/Caffeine demon_
- `progress`: how far along the assignment is
	- May be _Not started/Started/Nearly done/Finished_

It's recommended to use the [[Assignment]] template to add information about the assignment. This will not be displayed on the tracker
