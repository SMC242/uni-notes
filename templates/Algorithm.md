# Overview
A high-level explanation of the algorithm

# Properties
Data about the algorithm such as:
- [[Algorithm Analysis#Time complexities|Time complexity]]
	- Best case: $O()$
	- Worst case: $O()$
- Space complexity: $O()$
- [[Algorithm Strategies|Strategy type]]: 
- Stable? 
- Recursive?  If so, [[Recursion|what type]]?
