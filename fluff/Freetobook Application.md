# Motivations for applying
Full-stack web development has been my focus for the last 4 years, as I have learned TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. With my previous experience in React, I will be able to supercharge your migration from your previous Vue-based stack. I am also eager to learn more about AWS as I have used many services built on top of it. While I have previously worked with serverless architectures in my work experience and personal projects, I have yet to get practical with underlying providers such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. 

Since some of my family members work in the holiday tourism industry, I will be able to contribute my unique perspective as someone with both technical skills and an understanding of the needs of businesses and users in this space. This standpoint will allow me to design systems that meet previously unseen user requirements with scalable solutions. 

# Essential and desirable criteria

E.1)
I have been working on various side-projects since I was 14. This has given me a lot of practical experience at designing systems that not only work, but are also easy to maintain. 

Some notable projects are:
1. A tool for a video game called Planetside 2 that identified which characters belong to the same account. This tool functioned by comparing certain properties about a character and finding similar matches among millions. I refined a variety of skills throughout this project, such as data science (finding the correct properties, ensuring matching was accurate), fault-tolerant systems design (handling unreliability in the data source), and algorithmics (designing an algorithm that could efficiently compare character inventories while accounting for data loss due to the instability of the Planetside 2 API). This was developed using Python with FastAPI, DGraph (later MongoDB), and GraphQL
2. A plugin for a messaging app (Discord) that updated your status based on the user's current task. This was built using BetterDiscord, an unofficial framework for injecting plugins and themes into Discord and it was written in TypeScript. From this project, I gained experience with deeply exploring documentation to understand exactly how the system works. Unofficial modding is fraught with breaking changes and unintuitive workarounds, so diving deep into the internals of BetterDiscord and Discord itself was key to my success.

Additionally, I have worked on various websites to build my experience with Typ
