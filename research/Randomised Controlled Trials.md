# Overview
AKA double-blind RCT

- Randomised control: elligible patients are randomly allocated between the treatment and control groups
- Blind: the participants don't know they're getting the treatment or not (to avoid the [[#Placebo effect]])
	- Double-blind: the medic applying the treatment can't know either
		- The medic's body language can measurably change the outcomes
- Typically, new treatments are compared against the current most-effective treatment
	- For ethical reasons: giving people a bad treatment for the sake of the study when a better one is available
- Very expensive to run

## Publishing results
- Companies have a financial incentive to publish positive results
	- Companies run lots of trials and only publish the one trial that had a positive result (which would be a [[Hypothesis Testing|statistical outlier]])
	- They don't want to publish negative ones because funders might pull out of the research
- Trials must be pre-registered in a medical database before they're run to prevent this
