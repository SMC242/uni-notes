# Overview
When you get a small group (2 - 6 participants) in a room with 1 - 2 facilitators to talk for 1 - 2 hours

# Methods
- Co-questioning: participants ask each other questions that reveal information you couldn't have known otherwise
	- Unknown-unknowns
- Dual-facilitator method: one facilitator should lead the discussion while the other takes notes on who is talking least and timekeeping
	- Make space for quiet people - don't let people be talked over 
	- Call people holding their tongues out because they may have critical information that others are dancing around

# Audio recording
- Video record the session because differentiating multiple voices from audio is very difficult
