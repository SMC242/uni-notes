# Overview
When a researcher asks a series of questions to a participant. Three main types:
- [[#Structured]]
- [[#Unstructured]]
- [[#Semi-structured]]

# Structured
- Ask the same series of questions each time
- Basically a verbal [[Questionnaires|questionnaire]]
- Works best when there is a well-defined research question

# Unstructured
- Little to no predefined structured
- Helps when the research questions aren't fully formed yet

# Semi-structured
- An [[#interview protocol]] is followed in each interview
- Open-ended questions
- Follow-up questions
- Takes more time than a [[#structured]] interview

# Bias
- Recall bias: memory is fallible
	- Ask about recent events as far as possible
- Social acceptability bias: people will try to make themselves look good
	- Ask about specific actions
	- Probe deeper when given summaries and generalisations
	- Be careful to not prove into sensitive topics
		- If the participant is avoiding the question or being deliberately vague, don't press further

# Tips
- Ask survey questions first
	- Broad-scope questions that get the breadth of the participant's experience
	- Helps to build rapport and inform the participant of the scope
- Ask specific questions later
- Use past tense
	- Makes a question more specific
	- E.G "the last time you..." or "how did ... happen?"
- Ask about specific experiences
	- "How did ... happen?"
	- "Please can you give concrete examples?"
- Use neutral phrasing
- Help the participant to fill in information with clarifying questions
	- Details?
	- Actors?
	- Inner events?
- Silence can prompt the interviewee to elaborate
- Use markers
	- "You mentioned ..., {probing question}"

## Pitfalls
- Don't be intrusive
	- Will damage your rapport
- Try not to talk about yourself too much
- Make sure you transition smoothly between questions
	- Maintains natural flow
- Some participants are more insightful and/or responsive than others
	- Be careful that they don't provide unreliable information
	- Always cross-reference responses with other participants
	- Start with people who are easy to access
	- Start with people who are not very important
