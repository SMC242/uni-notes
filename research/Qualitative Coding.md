# Overview
A method for analysing qualitative data

Happens in 3 stages:
1. [[#Open coding]]
2. [[#Axial coding]]
3. [[#Selective coding]]

# Open coding
- Identify distinct pieces of information and extract them as "codes"
- Use the participants' own words

# Axial coding
- Categorise codes
- Categories don't need to be as specific as each other
	- E.G "gentle parenting strategies" and "life as a parent"
- Go back and re-code using this theory

# Selective coding
- Create a theory
- Connect the categories into central categories (themes/ideas)

# Reporting
- There should be a section for each main category
- Provide quotes
- Compare findings to other findings
