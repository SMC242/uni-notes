# Overview
A framework for research where the researcher immerses themselves in the group being studied. This allows the researcher to gain an insider's perspective. First properly practised by [[Bronislaw Malinowski]]

# Key ideas
- Subjectivity
- The ethnographer is a human instrument
	- Record information from all 5 senses as well as thoughts and feelings
- Immersion in the target group
	- Directly engaging with their ways of life 
		- Avoids the problem of desk sociology and reduces wariness from subjects (leads to more sincere engagement from the group)
- Long exposure
	- Fieldwork usually lasts many months (6 months - 2 years)
- The daily is important
	- Be open-minded and engage with the group's way of life
	- Try to drop the conventions you know
- Behaviour is grounded in cultural context

# Methods
- [[Participant Observation]]
	- [[Shadowing]]
- [[Interviews]]

# Planning
- Create research question
- Figure out who to talk to
- Find a location
- Create questions
- Look at previous research
- Check ethics
