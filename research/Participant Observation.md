# Overview
When a researcher watches the participant(s). There are two main types:
- [[#Complete observer]]
- [[#Complete participant]]

# Complete observer
- Passive observation
	- No active participation
- Researcher not necessarily integrated with the group
- Possibly in public spaces (E.G a library or city square)
	- Ethical concerns: it's impossible to ask every stranger for consent

# Complete participant
- Researcher immerses themself in the group
- Can take a long time
- Might lose detachment
	- It's necessary to maintain professional detachment in order to avoid bias
	- Called "going native"
- Observation without telling the participants you are a researcher (covert observation) is ethically dubious

## Integration
- It's easier to integrate into cultures that the researcher is already a part of 
- Being too close to the culture can cause bias: the researcher may not see things that an outsider would notice (E.G white person not noticing discriminatory policing)

# Field notes
- Field notes must be taken regularly and as soon after the events as possible
	- Notepads, audio, videos, pictures
- Write everything you see and hear
	- Your thoughts and feelings too
