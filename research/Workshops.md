# Overview
- A meeting with the goal of making decisions about the direction of the design process
- A type of [[Ideation Session]], specialised on top of [[Focus Groups]]
- Not a fixed number of participants
- The session duration should be 1 - 4 hours

# Activities
- Brainstorming: post-it-note walls rapidly generate ideas. The goal is volume
- Card-sorting: group the notes after brainstorming
- Prioritisation matrixes: important vs not important, easy vs not easy. Helps to find quick wins
- Future stories and persona creation: make up stories about a user in the ideal system and how that would look
- Break-out sessions: break down a large group into smaller ones. Helps with focus

# Tips
- Ask the opposite of your goal: "What would make this system way worse?"
	- Sometimes this draws out problems with the system 
- Tell participants they can lie a bit (it's easier to talk about a "friend" than yourself)
