# Overview
AKA systematic literature review, SLR

- A systematic search of available literature
- Can be equivalent to a large-scale RCT while being a lot cheaper to run
	- Drawback: the literature needs to exist. Somebody has to spend the money to run the studies
1. Systematic search: specify how you will search for studies
2. Study selection: screen studies with inclusion and exclusion criteria
3. Data extraction: extract key data from the studies (E.G health outcomes, age ranges)
4. Synthesis and analysis: collect the data and draw conclusions
