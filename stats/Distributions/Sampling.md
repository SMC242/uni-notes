# Definitions
As the sample size increases, the sample proportion will tend towards a normal distribution

## Point estimates
A point estimate $p$ is something like an average or standard deviation. It cannot be knwon without sampling the whole population. $\hat{p}$ represents the point estimate of the sample

## Sampling error
The variance between the estimates generated by repeating an experiment.

## Bias
An error that offsets results in one direction

# Central Limit Theorem
## Formulae
These are the formulae for CLT

- $\mu_\hat{p} = p$
- $SE_\hat{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p_)}{n}}$

## Conditions
- Independence
- Success-failure conditions
	- $np \ge 10$
	- $n(1 - p) \ge 10$

## Usage
This theory underpins a lot of statistics. You can use it to prove an assumption of normal distribution

# Confidence interval
1.96 is a significant number because it's the number of standard deviations away from the mean that wraps 95% of the data.

90%: 1.65
95%: 1.96
99%: 2.58

You have to check [[#Central Limit Theorem#Conditions|CLT conditions]] before doing this formally

## Formulae
95% confidence interval:
	$\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \times SE$

General form:
	$\hat{p} \pm z^* \times SE$
		where 
		$z^*$ is the confidence level

$z^* \times SE$ is also known as the margin of error

# Estimating sample size
Assume $p$ is 0.5 and solve for $n$:
$z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} < \textrm{margin of error}$

# Two $p$s
You can look at the difference between two proportions
$$SE=\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$
The confidence interval version:
$$\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$
