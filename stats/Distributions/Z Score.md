# Definition
The Z score is how many standard distributions a value is from the mean.

# Formula
$Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$

# Usage
Use this to check how weird a case is. Compare the magnitude of two Z scores ($|Z_1| > |Z_2|$?)

# Z tables
Z tables use a Z score to tell you the proportion of cases that lie before that case. This is also known as the percentile of a case. To get the percentage above the case, do $1 - z output$
