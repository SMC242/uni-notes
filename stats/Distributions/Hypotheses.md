These are the errors that can be made when doing a hypothesis test.

# Balancing risk
- $\alpha$ is the probability of making a type 1 error
- $\beta$ is the probability of making a type 2 error
- Power is $1 - \beta$

Increasing the power of a test reduces $\beta$ but increases $\alpha$ and vice versa
