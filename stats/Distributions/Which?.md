# When to use [[Geometric Distribution]]
When you need to know how many repetitions will be required to get a single success

- Independence required

# When to use [[Binomial Distribution]]
You want the probability of seeing a number of successes after $n$ reptitions

![[Binomial Distribution#Conditions]]

# When to use [[Binomial Distribution#Normal approximation|Normal Approximation of Binomial Distribution]]
When you have a big $n$ and you require a binomial distribution
![[Binomial Distribution#Normal approximation#Conditions]]

## When to use [[Binomial Distribution#Negative binomial distribution|Negative Binomial Distribution]]
When you want to count the number of repetitions to get a number of successes

## When to use [[Poisson Distribution]]
When you want the probability of seeing a number of events occur in a time period
