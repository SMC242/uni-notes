# Purpose
A geometric distribution is used to estimate how many times a random process would have to be repeated until a certain outcome occurs. __Independence is required__

X = 1 represents success and 0 is failure

# Bernoulli variables
The variable that can either be a success or failure.

## Characteristics
$p$ is the probability of $X$ being a success
$\mu = p$
$\sigma = \sqrt{p(1-p)}$

# Formula
$$(1-p)^{n-1}p$$
This outputs the probability of finding a success in $n$ repetitions

- $\mu= \frac{1}{p}$
- $\sigma^2 = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$
