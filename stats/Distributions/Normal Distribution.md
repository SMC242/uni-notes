# Overview
AKA the Gaussian distribution

- A distribution centred on the mean
- The variance $\sigma^2$ is its spread
- Due to the [[Sampling#Central Limit Theorem|Central limit theorem]], all variables will become normally-distributed with enough variables and trials
- Notation: $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$
