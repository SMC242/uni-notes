# Central Limit Theorem
## Formulae
These are the formulae for CLT

- $\mu_\hat{p} = p$
- $SE_\hat{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p_)}{n}}$

## Conditions
- Independence
- Success-failure conditions
	- $np \ge 10$
	- $n(1 - p) \ge 10$

## Usage
This theory underpins a lot of statistics. You can use it to prove an assumption of normal distribution
