# Overview
- If you take enough samples, the *means of the samples* will tend towards a [[Normal Distribution]]
	- This is why we repeat experiments
- Applies even if the population mean $\mu$ isn't normally distributed
- This theory underpins a lot of statistics. You can use it to prove an assumption of normal distribution
- Stabilises at $n = 30$

# Random variables
- This also works for random variables
- The sum of many random variables will tend towards a normal distribution
	- The [[Probability Distribution#Probability density function|PDF]] of this sum will tend towards a normal distribution

# Formulae
These are the formulae for CLT

- $\mu_\hat{p} = p$
- $SE_\hat{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p_)}{n}}$

# Conditions
- Independence
- Success-failure conditions
	- $np \ge 10$
	- $n(1 - p) \ge 10$
