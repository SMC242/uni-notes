# Overview
Statistics is the field of summarising and understanding data

See also: [[Research Map|Research Methods]]

# Core theories
- [[Events And Outcomes]]
- [[Independence]]

# Probability theory
Finding out how likely an outcome is

- [[Disjoint Events]]: modelling events that can't happen together
- [[Non-disjoint Events]]: events that can happen together
- [[Probabilistic Models]]: why it's useful to make predictions
- [[Probability Distribution]]: how to measure the probability of outcomes
- [[Joint Probability]]: the probability of two outcomes together
- [[Conditional Probability]]: the probability given prior information
- [[Predictions]]: expecting what a value will be
- [[Odds]]: how to talk about probability
- [[N-gram Models]]: modelling data as tuples

# Distributions
How data is distributed and properties of those distributions

- [[Normal Distribution]]: the most common distribution
	- [[Z Score]]: a metric of spread used when dealing with normal distributions
- [[Geometric Distribution]]: estimating how many trials are needed to guarantee an outcome
- [[Binomial Distribution]]: estimating the number of desired outcomes in a number of trials
- [[Poisson Distribution]]: estimating the number of desired outcomes in a *period of time*

See [[Which?]] for how to pick a distribution based on what you're estimating

# Sampling
How to take data from a distribution

- [[Sampling]]: the core theories behind sampling
	- [[Central Limit Theorem]]: why we can use the [[Normal Distribution]] so much
- [[Continuous Distributions]]: how to sample for continuous variables
- [[Multivariate Distributions]]: how to sample vectors

# Inference
Finding out information about the population from a sample

- [[Statistical Inference]]

# Hypothesis testing
Testing claims about data

- [[Hypothesis Testing]]
	- [[Confidence Interval]]: the range that you expect values to fall in
	- [[Conclusion Errors]]: the types of mistakes you can make while hypothesis testing
- [[T test]]: if the difference between two samples is noticeable

# Regressions
Modelling the tendency of data as a line

- [[Linear Regression]]
	- [[Least Squares Regression]]: a method for linear regression
	- [[Categorical Regressions]]: regressions on categorical variables
	- [[Hypothesis Testing on Linear Regressions]]
	- [[Outliers]]: how to handle unusual data
- [[Multiple Regressions]]: linear regression with multiple variables
	- [[Checking Conditions]]: some conditions are required. How do we check them?
	- [[Improving Models]]: how to make a model better
	- [[Pruning Models]]: removing unhelpful variables
- [[Residuals]]: a measure of error in a linear regression model
- [[Logistic Regression]]: regressions that output a binary answer

# Time series
Analysing data with a time dimension

- [[Seasonal Trends]]
- [[Trends]]: types of trends
