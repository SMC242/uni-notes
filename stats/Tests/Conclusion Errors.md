There are two classes of mistakes that can be made when [[Hypothesis Testing]]

![[Error Types.png]]

# Type 1
When you reject the null hypothesis **incorrectly**; a false positive.

# Type 2
When you fail to reject the null hypothesis when you should have rejected it; a false negative.

# Balancing risk
- $\alpha$ is the probability of making a type 1 error
- $\beta$ is the probability of making a type 2 error
- Power is $1 - \beta$

Increasing the power of a test reduces $\beta$ but increases $\alpha$ and vice versa
