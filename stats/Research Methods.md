# Overview
- Methods are split into two main groups: quantitative and qualitative

# Quantitative
- Generating summary statistics from large studies
- Every case will have the same fields

# Qualitative
- These methods focus on talking to people and analysing what they say
- Sample sizes are often smaller
- A script is often used, but the discussion may lead in different directions between interviews
