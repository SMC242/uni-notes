# Definition
Two events are not [[Disjoint Events|disjoint]] if they can occur at the same time. For example, there is no reason that you could not jump and breathe at the same time.

# Addition
When adding non-disjoint probabilities, you have to remove the overlap between the two events. For example: the overlap of the two events "card is red" and "card has the value 4" is 2/52 because there are 2 red cards in a deck of cards that have the value 4.

$P(\textrm{A or B}) = P(A) + P(B) - P(\textrm{A and B})$
