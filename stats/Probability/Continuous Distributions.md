# Overview
This note covers the complexities of dealing with continuous random variables

See first:
- [[Probability Distribution#Probability density function|Probability density functions]]

# Within range
$$P(X \in (a,b)) = (a \lt X \lt b) = \int_{a}^{b} f_{X}(x)$$
- The probability of $X$ being in the range $a..b$

# Support
$$supp(x) = \{ x | f_{X}(x) \gt 0 \}$$
- A [[Functions|function]] that finds the regions where the density is 0
- Fixed interval:
