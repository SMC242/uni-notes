# Outcomes
An outcome is when a random process produces a value, such as rolling a dice and reading the number. In that case, the specific number is the outcome.

# Events
Events are a set of outcomes, such as rolling an even number with a dice. That event would be $\{2, 4, 6\}$

# Complements
As in set theory, the complement of an event is all values not contained within the event. These values must be disjoint.

$P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$

A particularly useful formula for answering questions is $$P(\textrm{A or A}^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)$$
