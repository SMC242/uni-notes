# Definition
Algorithmics is the study of algorithms. Algorithms are processes of solving problems. Standard algorithms are developed by computer scientists and implemented in industry to meet the needs of sub-systems.

# Analysing algorithms
How algorithms are formally analysed to understand their efficiency

- [[Algorithm Analysis]]: the entry-point of this module
- [[Running Time]]: describing the growth of the running time of an algorithm
- [[Analysing Recursive Algorithms]]: methods for analysing [[Recursion|recursive]] algorithms
- [[Amortised analysis]]: analysing the average [[running time]] of repeated calls to a function
- [[Asymptotic Notation]]: the different notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm

# Algorithm types
Different methods of making algorithms

- [[Recursion]]: functions that call themselves
- [[Algorithm Strategies]]: common methods used by algorithms
