# Overview
Sorting a [[Directed Acyclic Graph]] such that if $u$ and $v$ have an edge $\overrightarrow{uv}$, $u$ will be before $v$. Each vertex is assigned a "label" which is used to order the vertices

Used for modelling systems with dependencies, such as dependent tasks

See [[Topological Ordering Algorithm]] for the algorithm
