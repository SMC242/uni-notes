Certainly, here's the template filled with relevant information about LZW decompression:

# Overview
LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) decompression is the process of reversing the LZW compression algorithm. It takes compressed data generated by LZW compression and restores it to its original, uncompressed form. LZW decompression works by using the same dictionary-based approach used during compression to reconstruct the original data.

# Properties
- **Time complexity**:
	- Best case: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the compressed data.
	- Worst case: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the compressed data.
- **Space complexity**: $O(m)$, where $m$ is the size of the dictionary used during decompression.
- **Strategy type**: LZW decompression employs a dictionary-based approach, reconstructing the original data based on the codes found in the compressed data.
- **Stable**: Yes, LZW decompression is a stable process, as it perfectly restores the original data from the compressed data.
- **Recursive**: No, LZW decompression does not involve recursion.

# Use case
LZW decompression is useful whenever you need to recover uncompressed data that has been previously compressed using LZW compression. It is typically used in scenarios where data needs to be transmitted or stored efficiently in a compressed form but must be returned to its original form for use.

# Vanilla implementation
The LZW decompression process consists of the following sub-procedures:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a dictionary with entries for all possible symbols, mirroring the dictionary used during compression.

2. **Decoding**:
   - Start with an empty buffer.
   - Read the compressed data one code at a time.
   - Translate each code into a sequence of symbols from the dictionary.
   - Output the sequence of symbols to reconstruct the original data.
   - Add a new entry to the dictionary representing the sequence of symbols encountered so far.
   - Repeat this process until all codes in the compressed data have been processed.

3. **Output the original data**: The output of the decompression process is the fully reconstructed original data.

# Variants
- Variations of the LZW decompression algorithm are usually straightforward and closely mirror the original LZW algorithm used for compression. The dictionary initialization and decoding processes may vary slightly depending on the specific implementation and format of the compressed data.
