# Definition
- Small teams
- Communicate with team members, bosses, and clients regularly
	- [[Scrum]] is often used for team communication
	- [[Prototyping]] is often used to help the client visualise a feature 
- Deliver smaller updates, but more frequently
- Makes heavy use of automation such as [[Continuous Integration]] and [[Automated Testing]] to work with less fear of breaking things
- Lesser emphasis on documentation
- Continual reviews of the software process
	- Not all techniques work for all projects
	- Therefore, refine the software development techniques for the specific project at hand

# Issues
- The customer might be unhelpful or change their mind a lot
- There may be multiple stakeholders with conflicting needs
	- Higher-up bosses want software delivered faster, leading to cut features and tech debt
- The contractual agreements can be fuzzy, leading to arguments between the developers and customers
- Lesser emphasis on documentation leads to forgetting why decisions were made
- Code quality can be pushed aside
- Small teams means coordinating many teams
	=> This is hard to get right

# Managing delays
- Software often gets delayed

## Extensions
- Asking the client to wait a bit longer for a [[Scrum#Releases|release]]

## Scope reduction
- Drop some features from the [[Scrum#Releases|release]]

## Reallocate resources
- Reduce resources required to deliver
	- Spend less time on non-critical parts of development, such as testing
	- Leads to more bugs
- Allocate more developers
	- Not easy because team members need to be trained
	- Increased team size can add overhead due to the need to communicate and synchronise
