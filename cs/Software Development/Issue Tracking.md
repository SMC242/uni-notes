# Overview
Issue tracking software like Jira, Bugzilla, and GitHub/GitLab Issues aim to visualise and manage the tasks that need to be done. The fundamental unit of such software is an [[#Issue]]

# Issue
A ticket that specifies a problem, enhancement, or suggestion for the program

# Kanban board
A method of issue tracking. They're divided into various headings such as "to do", "in progress", "in testing", and "finished". [[#Issue]]s are moved between headings as they are worked on

# Triage
Triage is the process of assigning priorities to [[#issue]]s. Some features and bugs are more important than others and must be worked on first

## Cost estimates
- An estimate of how much resources will be required to complete the task
	- Time
	- Money
	- Equipment

## Priority
- How urgent and important a task is

# Backlog
The list of [[#issue]]s that have not been allocated to a [[Scrum#Sprints|sprint]] yet

# Velocity
- The speed that the team is going through the issues
- Velocity often decreases with time
	- It's easier to write new code than adapt old code
- Often depicted with a burn down chart
