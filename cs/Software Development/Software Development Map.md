# Overview
Software engineering is the field of writing maintainable and scalable code; making architecture and technology decisions; and organisational structures. Design is also an important part of creating user interfaces

# Organisation
- [[Development Methodologies]]: How development is structured
	- [[Agile Development]]: not having a solid plan - "move fast, break things"
	- [[Scrum]]: frequent communication within the team and with customers
- [[Issue Tracking]]: keeping track of bugs, enhancements, and tasks

# Architecture


# Technologies
- [[Caching]]: saving frequently-used data in fast-access storage
- [[Authentication]]: ensuring users have access to content before revealing it
- [[Continuous Integration]]: automatic builds, linting, testing, and deployments

## Tools
- [[ORM]]: a high-level database interface
- [[Git]]: a version control system
- [[Automated Testing]]: automatic tests to check that the program works as intended

# Patterns
Programming patterns are well-known solutions to common problems

See [[Design Pattern Map]]

# Paradigms
Constraints on how you program in order to give certain benefits
