# Overview
- "Memory" usually refers to the Random Access Memory (RAM) of a computer
- This memory holds temporary data
	- Flushed when the program closes or the computer shuts down

See also: [[Pointers]]

# Addresses
- Each location in memory has a unique address
	- To be more specific: each byte in memory has its own address

## Locality
- Memory addresses close to each other are faster to access because there is less jumping around
- Preferably, data should be in a contiguous block
	- This is why [[arrays]] are so fast
