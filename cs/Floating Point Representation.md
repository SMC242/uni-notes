# Overview
- Floats are a way to represent real numbers
	- Deterministic approximations
	- Used for huge, tiny, or fractional numbers
- They are used for scientific, statistical, and graphical computations
	- **NEVER** use them for financial programming
	- See: [[#Financial Decimals]]

# Format
There are two common sizes of floating point numbers: 32 bit (float) and 64 bit (double \[precision\])

- A sign bit
- [[#Mantissa]]
- [[#Exponent]]
