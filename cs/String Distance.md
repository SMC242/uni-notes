# Overview
There are various methods for comparing string similarity

## Formal definition
Given $s = s_{0}s_{2}..s_{m-1}$ and $t=t_{0}t_{2}..t_{n-1}$, what is the least number of operations required to convert $s$ to $t$

# Operations
- Insert: add a character
- Delete: remove a character
- Substitute: replace a character

Some models attach a cost to each of these operations

# Alignment
You can juxtapose two strings and insert spaces where required to visualise the difference between two strings
