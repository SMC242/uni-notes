# Overview
A quick summary of what a particular user might want to do with the system. Less detailed than [[personas]]

# Format
> As an {actor}, I want to {action} so that I can {rationale} 

- Actor: the person using the system (typically their occupation title, such as student or manager)
- Action: what they want to do *or* what they want to happen
- Rationale: the task they want to complete *or* the need they want to fulfil (I.E the goal)

# Refinement
- After the user stories have been negotiated with the customer, they must be converted to tasks in the [[Issue Tracking|issue tracker]]

# Story quality
A good user story has all of the following qualities:

- Independence: it shouldn't depend on other user stories
- Negotiable: you can talk about it with the customer
- Valuable: it should be clear why the actor cares about this feature
- Estimable: it is possible to [[Task Estimation|estimate]] how long it would take to implement
- Small: large stories can be hard to break down into tasks
- Testable: it should be possible to create [[scenarios]] for the story, and create tests to validate that the implementation meets the requirements

This is called the [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) framework
