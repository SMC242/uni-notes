# Overview
- Unary functions are infinite [[Types#Mappings|mappings]] from $S$ to $T$
- Cardinality is $\#S = \infty$

# Operations
- Construction
- Application: calling ("applying") a function with ("to") an argument

# Binary functions
$$
f: (S_{1}\times S_{2}) \rightarrow T
$$
- A binary function's arguments are a product type because most programming languages view arguments as tuples
	- Haskell views functions as a series of unary functions
- General form: $f: (S_{1} \times \dots \times S_{n}) \rightarrow T$
