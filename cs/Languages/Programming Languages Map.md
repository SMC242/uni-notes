# Overview
Programming languages are tools for describing programs to a computer. They each offer many different features and are typically designed with certain domains in mind

# Theory
- [[Syntax]]: how the syntax of a program is specified
- [[Translators]]: how compilers and interpreters work
	- [[Tombstone Diagram]]: diagrams for drawing compiler dependencies
	- [[Virtual Machines]]: intermediate interpreters for portability
	- [[Compiler Bootstrapping]]: how the first compiler was made

## Type theory
#TypeTheory

- [[Type Systems]]
