# Overview
Programming languages are tools for describing programs to a computer. They each offer many different features and are typically designed with certain domains in mind

# Theory
- [[Syntax]]: how the syntax of a program is specified
- [[Translators]]: how compilers and interpreters work
	- [[Tombstone Diagram]]: diagrams for drawing compiler dependencies
	- [[Virtual Machines]]: intermediate interpreters for portability
	- [[Compiler Bootstrapping]]: how the first compiler was made
	- [[Abstract Syntax Tree]]: representing the commands in the program
- [[Scopes]]: where a variable is defined

## Type theory
#TypeTheory
Theories relating to grouping values into types and verifying the sanity of operations

- [[Types]]
- [[Type Systems]]

# Writing compilers
How to make your own compiler

- [[Translating Constructs]]: translating to machine code
- [[Compilation Phases]]: how to make a compiler
	- [[Syntactic Analysis]]: checking that the syntax is correct
	- [[Contextual Analysis]]: checking that the types and [[scopes]] are correct
	- [[Code Generation]]: deciding what code to emit and generating code
