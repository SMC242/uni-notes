# Overview
The field of secure interaction where there could be malicious actors or the parties don't trust each other

- Provides:
	- Confidentiality via [[Cryptography]]
	- Integrity via [[Hashing]] and [[checksums]]
	- Availability 
- Can prevent or detect attacks
- The security of a cryptographic system are provable
	- This allows you to make evidence-driven decisions

# Fields
- [[Symmetric Cryptography]]: the same key is used by both parties
- [[Asymmetric Cryptography]]: two keys are used: one for local use and another for distribution
