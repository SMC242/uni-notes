# Overview
Ideas for research questions for my [[Docker Vulnerabilities Map|Docker Vulnerabilities disseration]]

# Efficiency vs effectiveness

Which DAST toolchain has the best trade-off between speed and vulnerabilities uncovered?

- [[Between vs Within Designs#Within subjects|Within-subjects]] design

# Best combination of tools

Which two tools together uncover the most vulnerabilities?

- Comparison to: one single tool (Docker Scout)
- Could use for [[Dynamic Application Security Testing|DAST]] or [[Static Application Security Testing|SAST]]

1. What tools are available? 
2. Which ones fit together to produce something better?
3. Can I build tool that bridges the gaps between two tools?

# Are native tools better?

Does [[Docker SAST Tools|Docker Scout]] outperform other [[Docker SAST Tools|SAST tools]]?

- Scout is developed in-house so may have access to expertise that third-party tools don't
