# Overview
- Every design process should involve people with many different accessibility needs because it will make your process better

# Dynamic diversity
- People's ability levels change as they age and even day-to-day
	- Sometimes people forget their aids (E.G glasses)
- Key concept: accessibility needs change as daily circumstances change
- Diversity increases with age and poor health
