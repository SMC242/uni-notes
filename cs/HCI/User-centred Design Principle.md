# Overview
> The people who pay for the design don't use the system, therefore we design the wrong things

Key tools:
- [[Interviews#Unstructured|Unstructured interviews]]
	- Good for getting insights into their work
	- You'll find out things you had no idea about
- [[Interviews#Semi-structured|Semi-structured interviews]]
	- For answering specific design questions
- Focus groups
	- Allows [[stakeholders]] to question each other ("co-questioning")
		- Helps you discover [[#Knowing unknowns|unknown unknowns and unknown knowns]]
	- They will often come up with questions you didn't think to ask
- Workshops
	- Brainstorming with [[stakeholders]] and get feedback
	- Ideation sessions

# Evaluation tools
- Hallway interviews (ask people quick questions in the hallway of the hospital)
- Field studies
	- Effectiveness in real world
- Surveys
	- Attitudes on your solution
# Knowing unknowns
- Sometimes you know that you don't know something: "known unknown"
- Sometimes you don't know something and also don't know that: "unknown known"
	- Unwritten rules, often combining two independent pieces of information
		- 
	- AKA "tacit knowledge"
- Some things you have no way to discover: "unknown unknowns"
