# Overview
- Robot assisted surgery
 - Electronic health records: a large national database of health records
 - Telehealth services
 - Medical imaging and diagnostics: MRI machines

# Improving patient engagement
- Wearable devices: realtime monitoring for proactive healthcare 
- Patient portals: the ability to contact your GP and access medical records online. Also makes scheduling appointments easier
- Remote monitoring: monitoring patients that could fall or have an attack at home

# Behaviour change
- Doctors struggle to induce behaviour change because patients forget to do the advice after a while
	- "The stickiest problem in healthcare"
- Apps are great for reminding people to do things
	- Take medication
	- Look away from the screen
	- Take a walk
- You can gameify it to make it enjoyable
	- For competitive people, you can show them a ghost player that is slightly better than them to encourage them to try harder 
	- For less competitive people, you can make them win against the ghost
- Can give real-time feedback and adapt interventions using the data

## Video coaching
- Can be delivered remotely
- Can be personalised to the patient
	- Example: the patient can record a video of them doing the treatment in the video and the clinician can give feedback
	- Also asynchronous, so scheduling is not a problem
- Regular appointments provide continuous engagement helps patients stay accountable

## Peer support networks
- Putting people in digital groups with a similar problem
	- This allows you to connect people with rare conditions so they feel less alone
	- Built on [[Informal Healthcare Systems]]
- Helps with mental health due to shared experience
	- Helps you build community by helping others, giving you purpose
	- You may also make friends
- Adds collaborative problem solving
- In-person is better if feasible
	- Digital support networks are best for rare conditions and rural people
	- Also conditions where privacy is preferred such as HIV and gender dysphoria
- Downside: can propagate bad news, temporarily worsening everyone's mood
	- E.G trans rights being lost
	
# Problems
- Data security: this is deeply confidential information
	- Often the infrastructure is very outdated
- Misdiagnosis
