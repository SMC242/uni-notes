# Overview
The study of how *scarce* resources are allocated among alternatives for sickness, promotion, and maintenance of health

# Economic evaluations
- 3 types of analysis:
	- Cost-effectiveness 
	- Cost-utility
	- Cost-consequence

## Cost-effectiveness
- Key metric: cost-per-unit-output
	- Unit cost and consequences (unit of benefit)

### Cost-effectiveness plane
- C is the comparator (what you're comparing against, usually an existing treatment) - similar to a control
- The dashed line is the "willingness to pay threshold"
	- Countries define their threshold, the UK uses Â£20-30k
- Remember that there's costs of not treating people: hospital fees, GP appointments
	- Even if a treatment is very expensive, it might be less costly than treating the symptoms

## Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve
- Created by plotting the density of QALYs gained vs cost per unit and seeing how many fall on either side of the willingness-to-pay-threshold

## Cost-utility
- Key metric: cost per QALY
	- Consequences (QALYs)
		- Quality-adjusted life year
		- A score from 0..1 where 0 = dead, perfectly healthy = 1
		- 
	- Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
		- The patient decides this, not the clinician


### EQ5D
- EQ5D is a self-completed, cognitively simple questionnaire across 5 domains of life. Used for quantifying utility
	- Mobility
	- Self-care
	- Usual activities
	- Pain/discomfort
	- Anxiety/depression
- Creates a coefficient from 0..1 that measure how healthy the person is
- Utility is an individual's preference for a given health state
	- 0 = death, 1 = perfect health

## When to run
- Alongside trials
- Helps to motivate the deployment of a treatment
- It's easier to not deploy than withdraw a deployment
- You can still adjust the technology 
- It's a lot cheaper to run this way because it can be embedded in the study
