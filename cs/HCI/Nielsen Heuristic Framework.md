# Overview
A fundamental framework for analysing usability

See https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/

# Heuristics

## Visibility of status
- Can users see what state the system is in? E.G seeing that they're in vim's normal mode

## System-world match
- Avoid inventing new jargon
- Stick to real-world conventions

## User control and freedom
- Make it easy to control changes
- Undo and redo buttons

## Consistency and standards
- Stay consistent within your app and other apps

## Error prevention
- Make common usage errors easy to avoid
- Check that a user knows what they're doing before doing destructive actions

## Recognition over recall
-  Display all the information a user needs on the page

## Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Add shortcuts for power users

## Aesthetic and minimal design
- Don't clutter the screen

## Recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Make errors easy to understand and show how to resolve them

## Help and documentation
- Provide adequate documentation for the user to refer to when they're stuck
