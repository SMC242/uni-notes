# Overview
A variety of factors affect adoption of technologies. This is particularly true in social scenarios because users may feel judged

# Performative interaction
- Users feel like they're being observed all the time ("spotlight effect")
- They adjust their behaviour to be socially acceptable
- They also have their own feelings about using the device
	- They might think it looks silly

> [!EXAMPLE] Google Glass
> As the Google Glass had a camera in it, non-users felt like they were being recorded by users. This led to stigma around the product and it was not adopted

## Spectators
- The spectators might not understand what the user is doing
- They might judge the user

## Factors
Some factors that influence social acceptance:
- Visibility (E.G using the device draws attention)
- Setting (using the device at inappropriate times)
- Comfortability with using the device
- Impressions about the device
- Familiarity
	- People are more likely to reject things they don't know
- Behaviour
	- Devices may cause antisocial behaviour

# Increasing social acceptance
## General rules
- Avoid unusual inputs/outputs
	- Make it clear what the user is doing to reduce judgement from others
	- E.G touching your nose, strange noises, looking around
- Avoid inputs/outputs that draw attention
	- Loud noises
	- Big movements
	- Flashing
- Avoid actions with unclear targets
	- Shaking device
	- Voice-activated actions can be unclear
	- Camera in glasses (spectators feel like they're being recorded)
- Reduce visibility
	- Use vibration instead of audio
- 
## Spectators
- Recognition may improve spectator acceptance
- It helps if there is a visible outcome after the interaction
	- This helps the spectator to figure out that the user is interacting with a device

## Gesture design
Gestures that follow these rules are more likely to be accepted:
- Hands near torso
- Small movements
- Short duration

Gestures following these rules are less visible

## Device location
These device locations are more likely to be accepted:
- Wrist
- Forearm
- Hands

These device locations are less likely to be accepted:
- Neck
- Waist 
- Torso
