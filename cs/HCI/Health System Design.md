# Overview

There are separate challenges for design vs the technology itself

> [!NOTE] Design challenges
> There are challenges for the systems we make and there are other challenges for how we design them. You need to separate these challenges as much as possible, but often they overlap
> 
> Example: you need to make a technology that blind people can interact with. That is the design challenge. However, accessing blind people is difficult because you need to design patient recruitment processes that they can find (E.G posters won't work). That is a challenge for the design process

> [!WARNING] Don't assume [[Digitising Healthcare|digital systems]] are always the solution
> You must justify *why* it's better. Digitising without reason often just makes the system worse
# Challenges

- Difficult to access patients
	- Hospitals don't let strangers into hospitals and you need to go through ethics processes
	- Doctors are incredibly busy and their time is valuable
		- Every second they spend talking to you is not spent with a patient
- Failure isn't acceptable in healthcare (people die) whereas failure is part of design: fail fast, fail forward
	- Doctors are cautious of designs after they ask a wrong question
- Extremely complex systems and processes
	- No individual understands the whole process, just their part of the pipeline
	- Researchers must ask many employees
## Identifying stakeholders

- Lots of types of [[stakeholders]]
	- Doctors
	- Patients
	- Administrators
	- Regulators
- Conflicting priorities
- Expensive
- At the end of [[Interviews]], ask "Who else should I talk to?" and "Are there any questions I haven't asked you but should?"

# User-centred design
![[User-centred Design Principle]]


# Empathy
- Stepping into another person's shoes to understand their feelings and perspectives to guide our actions
- Uncovers latent needs + desires
- Simulation doesn't count! Don't try walking with a walking stick for a day, it won't tell you about how other people feel
	- Often, your simulations will be based on your biases and pathologisation of their condition
- Holistic approaches are important

## Benefits
- People trust you more and open up
- People sometimes don't tell you their actual feelings and may brush you off. You can sense this and ask extra questions
	- Particularly in British culture where complaining is seen as bringing down the mood
- People will accept you using wrong terminology if you seem like you've genuinely tried to learn
- Remember that people are much more than their health condition
	- Not doing this leads to misattributing things to their condition ("medicalisation")
		- Causes treatments to be applied for no reason and restricting patient freedom
		- Example: always telling a person living with Alzheimers to get back inside even though they might just want a walk
	- Refer to people as "person living with x" in most cases 

# Experience-centred design
![[Experience-centred Design Principle]]


# Designing for specific conditions
## Cognitive impairments
- Make everything straight-forward
	- Minimise clutter
	- Avoid complex wording so they don't need to reason about its content
- When doing research, allow more time and breaks

## Visual impairments
- Adapt recruitment: audio and braille adverts
- Adapt design methods: no mind-maps; prototypes must be tactile or audio-guided
- High contrast and large font options

## Chronic conditions
- Engage with their experience with the condition
	- People early in their journey will need different treatments from someone experienced
- Discretion is important because people might not want to publicly disclose their condition
- Limit session length
- Help people connect with others and leverage existing groups for participant recruitment
