# Overview
Each country has a healthcare system
- Composed of a large network of components
	- Government organisations, institutions
	- Charities
	- Online resources
- Important for society and the economy to have healthy people

# Working with informal systems
- There are often [[Informal Healthcare Systems|informal carers]] involved and formal healthcare systems must cooperate with them

# Models

## Publicly-funded healthcare
- Huge, very complex to run

### Free at the point of use
- Examples: UK
- When healthcare is free when you use them and as much as you use them
	- Paid for by taxes
- Sometimes, the government doesn't provide enough money to run certain services or support the number of patients
	- Results in services technically existing but waitlists are unrealistically long (10+ years for initial appointments)
- Overuse drains the system

## Insurance-based
- Examples: USA, Germany, Switzerland
- Patients pay insurance to a private company and claim back the costs of treatment
- Coverage is limited: not all healthcare plans cover every condition
	- People can't predict getting conditions 
- Cost can bankrupt people

## Out-of-pocket
- Examples: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan
- Paid for at hospitals
- Can bankrupt people or push them to risk going to a cheaper hospital and die on the way
- Easiest to implement
- Common in countries early in their development

## Hybrid models
- Essential services are covered but private insurance is used for choices and faster access
- Private treatments are very expensive

# The UK
- [[#Free at the point of use]] model, partially [[#Hybrid models|hybrid]]

## GPs
- First point of contact
