# Overview
Questionnaires are a sequence of questions used in a survey

# Types of questions
## Closed
- Questions with a limited set of responses
- Use these when:
	- The set of responses is determinable and ergonomic

### Scales
The following scales have been proven to work well. Be careful to avoid doing statistical analyses on differing scales
#### Unipolar
On a scale of nothing to a big amount:
1. Not at all
2. Slightly
3. Moderately
4. Very
5. Extremely

#### Bipolar
On a scale of a negative amount to a positive amount:
1. Extremely \[negative]
2. Moderately \[negative]
3. Slightly \[negative]
4. Neither
5. Slightly \[positive]
6. Moderately \[positive]
7. Extremely \[positive]

#### Likert
Provide a statement for the respondent to rate
1. Strongly agree
2. Agree
3. Neutral
4. Disagree
5. Strongly disagree

## Open-ended
- A question that prompts the user to write a response
- Use these for:
	- Numbers
	- Qualitative data

# Problems
## Measurement error
- The answers can be wrong
	- The respondent might not give truthful answers (lack of attention or lying)
	- Questions may be confusing
	- Input methods may be inconvenient
- Can't clarify bad answers
- Can't improve questions once the questionnaire has been deployed
	- Would invalidate previous answers


## Bias
There are 5 main types of response bias that affect questionnaires

### Satisficing
- Users might not respond with the true answer
	- They may not be paying attention
- Weak satisficing is when the answer is close enough, but not ideal
- Strong satisficing is when the answer is random

### Solutions
- Avoid: n/a or "no opinion" options
- Avoid repetitive questions that use *the same scale*
- Keep the questionnaire short
- Tell the respondent how important the research is

## Acquiescence
- Respondents are more likely to agree than disagree if presented with a yes/no question]
### Solutions
- Neutral phrasing

## Social desirability
- Respondents try to make themselves look good

## Response order bias
- Respondents pick the first or last choices more frequently

### Solutions
- Alternate scale orders
	- I.E alternate between positive -> negative and negative -> positive
- Randomly order categorical answers

## Question order
- The order of questions can affect the responses

### Solutions
- Randomise question order
	- Always keep demographic questions at the start because they are introductory questions
- If randomisation isn't possible: start with broad/easier or more important questions and get more specific later
	- Limits the effects of dropout or reduces chances of dropping out

# Bad questions
- Broad questions
	- Noisy data + can be confusing
- Leading questions
	- Use neutral phrasing
- Double-barrelled questions
	- Keep separate questions separate
- Recall questions ("when did you last...")
	- Memory is inaccurate
- Predictions
	- Respondents give very biased responses

# Experience surveys
- Regularly ask for responses
- Make them short
- Ask about the present, not the past
	- Avoids recall

# Intercept survey
- Triggered by an action
	- E.G after buying something
- Minimises effects of recall
- Annoying
