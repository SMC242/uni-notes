# Overview
While it's impossible to avoid errors entirely, it's best to limit the number of possible errors

# Solutions
- Find the sources of errors
	- Once found, find ways to minimise them
- Allow reverting actions
- Aid error discovery (provide help to understand the problem)
- Make errors easier to fix
- Use [[#forcing functions]]

# Forcing functions
- [[Intuitive Design#Constraints|Constraints]] that force a behaviour
- Can be annoying

> [!NOTE] Interlocks
> A forced sequence of actions
> 
> Example: you must create an account before signing in

> [!NOTE] Lock-ins
> Preventing an action from stopping
>
> Example: you cannot shutdown your computer while a file lock is held

> [!NOTE] Lockouts
> Preventing an action
>
> Example: Barriers prevent people from riding their cars off cliffs
