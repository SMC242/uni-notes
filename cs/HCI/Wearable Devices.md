# Overview
Wearables are devices that are worn on the body such as a smart watch or earbuds

- Unrestrictive
	- Don't get in the way
- High availability
	- Always within reach
- Aware
	- Can sense the [[cs/HCI/Context|Context]]
- Intimacy
	- It can have skin-contact which allows medical applications (E.G heartbeat sensing)
- Proactive
	- The device can take action without you taking your phone out of your pocket

# Challenges
- Small/no screen
	- Little visual output
	- Can't type
- Limited input modalities
- Movement
	- Can be difficult to interact with a small device while moving
	- Difficult to filter out movement data
		- People gesture, walk, run
- Aesthetics
	- Limited by comfort
		- Can't be heavy, bulky, or unusual
	- Must fit the user's style

# Form factors
- Wrists: watches, bracelets
- Head earbuds, glasses
- Fingers: rings
- Feet: shoes

# Input modalities
## Buttons/dials
- Physical controls
- Simple to use
- Eyes-free
- Haptic feedback
- Mapping functionality can be difficult
	- Not enough buttons for every function

## Touchscreen
- Familiar
- Input and output are coupled
- Will be tiny on a wearable
	- People will miss targets
	- Their fingers will occlude the target

## Touch panels
A panel that you can slide your finger across

- Easily integrated into glasses, wristbands, and rings
- Little visual feedback
- Miniaturised input devices are a double-edged sword
	- More portable
	- But hard to discover

## Gestures
- Best for wearable computers
- Eyes-free
- Unrestrictive
- Sensed by wearables
	- I.E an external device is required such as rings or a controller
- Can be intuitive to use
	- We're good at moving our bodies
- Tiring

### Gloves
- Directly measures finger motions
- Provides input and output
	- E.G a screen or haptics
- Many [[Mixed Reality Tracking#Degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]]
- Lots of gestures are possible
	- Due to having more flex points (at each joint)

## Speech
- Easy to perform
- Poor [[Adoption#Performative interaction|social acceptability]]
- Speech recognition fails in noisy environments

## Device movement
- Unrestrictive
- Discreet
- Eyes-free

Example interactions:
- Twisting a ring
- Twisting or pushing a watch face
- Nodding while wearing a device on your head

# Output modalities
## Offloading
- Output to another device
	- E.G the user's phone or headphones

## Projected screens
- Projecting a screen onto a surface such as your wrist
	- From glasses on a watch
- Use occlusion of the light to sense inputs

## Haptics
- Many signals can be represented
- Can be directional
	- E.G a map app that vibrates the left/right motor when you need to turn
