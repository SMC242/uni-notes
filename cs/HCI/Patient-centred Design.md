# Overview
Fronting the patient's needs is crucial for delivering effective healthcare. It must be:
1. User-centred: tailored to the patient's needs 
	- Summary statistics hide important details
2. Personalised: they should be able to customise the system to their needs and preferences (E.G to accommodate disabilities)
3. Holistic: understand all of their needs (physical, emotional, cultural, socio-economical)
4. Empowering: make patients feel involved and active in decisions about their health

# Why?
Improves:
- Outcomes: tailored solutions result in higher effectiveness of treatments
- Satisfaction: feeling listened to and involved results in better perception of the healthcare system
- Adherence rates: patients are more likely to stick to their treatment plans/use the provided tools/follow advice
- Efficiency: streamlining processes, reducing medical errors (reducing deaths due to mistakes!), effective resource utilisation

Challenges:
- Lots of [[Stakeholders]] with conflicting needs
	- Doctors and administrators have more power than patients
- Speaking to patients is difficult (privacy, medical conditions, logistics)
- Doctors are incredibly busy
- Overemphasis of expert opinions
- Disempowered patients: patients are traditionally passive and don't have a voice

# Co-design methods
- Working with [[Stakeholders]] to design technology and democratise access to the tech
- Workshops are an example
