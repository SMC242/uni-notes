# Overview
Mobile devices are used in many different situations. These situations ("contexts") affect which features are used and how they are used

# Constraints
## Environment
The environment affects which features can be perceived

- A train vibrates a lot, so haptic feedback may not be noticed
- Light themes hurt users' eyes in dark environments
- Notification pings might not be heard in a concert

## Motion
- People don't want to look at their phones while they're walking
- Typing while walking is difficult

## Connectivity
- Connection may fluctuate as a user moves (E.G under a tunnel)
- They may turn off their data whenever possible

## Situational demands
Constraints introduced by the user's current activity

- A user may have other things in their hands
- They might not be able to pay full attention 
- They might be driving, so looking at the device must be minimised

# Situation impairment
- When a context makes it harder to use a feature of a device

> [!EXAMPLE] Examples
> - Holding a page in one hand
> 	- Only one hand is available to interact
> - Bright environments
> 	- Screen glare makes it harder to see content
> - Busy street
> 	- Can't hear audio
> - Walking
> 	- Need to watch surroundings
