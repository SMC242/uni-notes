# Overview
People may keep using a system because they like them. There are many reasons why:
- They feel it helps them
- The tool is enjoyable to use or looks pleasing/cool
	- Having something to show off to your friends can give you pride
	 - Avoid making tools that look cheap or tacky
	 - Example: allowing people to customise their stoma bags with skins
- People can become attached to their support tools because they associate them with managing their condition better
	- They might push back on change, even if it's provably better
