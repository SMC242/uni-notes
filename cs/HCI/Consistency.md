# Overview
- Consistency means following conventions within your software
- Users will be confused when things change arbitrarily
	- They may think it has a different purpose when it does not

> [!NOTE] Treat like elements the same
> Elements that fulfil similar purposes should be treated the same. If one is more important, you may change aspects of it, but only up to 2 aspects (E.G colour and shadow)

# Types
## Internal
- Choices made within the app should apply throughout the app

## External
- Consistency with common patterns in similar software

# Elements of consistency
- [[Layout]]
- Typography 
- [[Colour]]s
- Imagery
	- Consistent logos, icons, art styles
- Control and feedback
	- Use the same UI elements across the app
