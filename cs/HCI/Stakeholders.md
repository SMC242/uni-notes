# Overview
It's crucial to identify the relevant people when designing health tech

3 steps:
1. Identify: the relevant stakeholders
	- Difficult because getting a list of people with an illness is impossible
	- Usually done by asking doctors to send patients your way
2. Access: the stakeholders
	- You may need to go through ethical applications or staff
	- Internal services make themselves difficult to access to avoid being flooded with tasks (limited resources)
3. Collaborate: can be challenging when different systems don't cooperate with each other
	- May have conflicting needs
	- Patients and doctors can drastically disagree and the power relationship can affect what people say
