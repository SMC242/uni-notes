# Overview
- Users are typically older
	- May have impairments that make certain interactions harder
- Massive diversity in patients
- Have to integrate with gigantic networks of legacy software
- Multi-disciplinary: many different approaches to the same problems due to differing fields of specialisation
- Ethics must constantly be considered
	- Poor software can cost lives
	- Ethics boards can limit what is possible
		- Ethics reviews can take an entire year
		- Iteration is slow
- Privacy is crucial because these systems hold so much private information

# IT Competency
- There is a huge gap in tech literacy
	- Along age and class boundaries
- Analogue alternatives must be available
- Rural communities may not be able to access online services
- [[Touchscreens]] fail to detect some people's touches (particularly old people)

# Global South
- Literacy rates are lower in the Global South
- Lack of tech infrastructure/devices or consistent access to them

# Immersion
- Terminology changes frequently
	- People don't trust you when you get terminology wrong
	- Or could be offended (E.G transgender healthcare)
- The relevant laws must be monitored and can dramatically change the way the software is allowed to work
