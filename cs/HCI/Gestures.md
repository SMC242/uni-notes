# Overview
Gestures are powerful for making intuitive interactions, but they have problems with discovery

Users might not know:
- Which gestures are available
- Where/when to use them
- How to do the gesture correctly
- How to troubleshoot
	- Improve their performance of the gesture

# Discovery
## Opt-in
- Gives an opportunity to show the user how to do the gesture
- Avoids accidental gestures
- More efficient: the relevant sensors won't be active unless the user wants the gesture to be available

# Feedback
- Give as much feedback as possible
	- Visual
	- Audio
	- Vibration
- Confirm that the system is responding to a gesture
- Visualise the data that the sensors are using
	- Hand silhouette on handprint sensor
