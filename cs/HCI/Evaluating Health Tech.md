# Placebo effect
- The placebo effect has measurable impacts
	- People tend to recover with or without an intervention
	- But people see that they were given a treatment and assume they recovered because of it
- Brightly-coloured pills are more effective than plain, white ones
- Being honest about placebo pills still has an impact!
- Can be just as effective as a treatment

# Evidence-based medicine
- Medicine focuses on large, randomised, controlled trials
- Draws from patient values, clinical expertise (the doctor's experience), and available evidence to inform decisions
- [[Digitising Healthcare|Digital Health Tech]] can enhance this due to greater data collection and centralisation of that data
	- Persuasive design can leverage the [[#Placebo effect]] to improve outcomes


# Metrics
## Impact factor
AKA IF

- How big of a change does the treatment make?
- All drugs will have different levels of impact: proving that it makes an impact isn't enough

## Technology readiness level
AKA TRL

- How close a technology is to being ready for launching to patients
- Informs what kinds of testing to do at each step
- Don't do an RCT too early or you'll waste tonnes of money testing the wrong thing

# Methods
## Randomised controlled trials
![[Randomised Controlled Trials]]
## Systematic meta reviews
![[Systematic Literature Reviews]]

## Cohort studies
- Look at groups naturally exposed to a treatment/condition (E.G lead pipes)

## Epidemiological studies
- Look at hot-spots of a condition to see if there's a location element (E.G contaminated water supplies)

## Case reports and case series
- Doctors report cases and researchers look at many similar cases and look at the pattern
	- Low-quality evidence but a good starting-point
- Good for finding rare diseases 

# Challenges
- Designing effective double-blinds
- Treatments can damage some peoples' health or have long-term consequences
