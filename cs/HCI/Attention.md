# Overview
Users pay varying levels of attention depending on their situation

> [!NOTE] Key concept: fragmented attention
> A user's attention is divided between the device and their surroundings.

# Multi-tasking
- Multi-tasking heavily affects attention
	- Attention span
	- Spatial and social awareness
	- Fragmented attention

## Task switching
- Users pay attention in bursts
	- 4 - 14 seconds
- Switches occur frequently

# Designing for mobile
- Mobile apps are often used in distracting environments
- When designing mobile apps, you need to expect:
	- Lack of visual attention (not looking at the screen all the time)
	- Not noticing changes ("change blindness")
	- Interruption
	- Fragmented input (E.G typos, infrequent inputs)
	- Slow responses
- Avoid requiring too much attention

## Heuristics
- Clear: make it easy to find things \[with minimal reading\]
- Patient: don't demand constant attention
- Simple: don't overwhelm the user with features
- Multi-sensory: reduce reliance on visual attention
	- Use vibration, light, sound
- Flexible: support multiple input modalities

# Safety
- If a device is using too many cognitive resources, they may stop using it
- However, they might tunnel-vision on it instead
	- Could be dangerous or disruptive
