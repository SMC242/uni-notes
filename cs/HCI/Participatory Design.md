# Overview
- A theory underpinning design focused on shifting control from the people who pay for the tech and build it to the people who use it
- A **conversation** with all [[Stakeholders]] with **space** for genuine arguments with comparable benefits and **control** over the process
- Generally [[Qualitative vs Quantitative#Qualitative|qualitative]] methods: focus groups, workshops, interviews

- Conversation:
	- Multiple meetings
- Space:
	- Present your interpretation of feedback to the people who gave you it
	- Stakeholders need to be able to say no
- Control:
	- Co-developing helps people to feel in control of their treatment, making them more likely to participate in the treatment
	- All parties learn from it
	

> [!WARNING] What it's not
> It's not just letting patients participate in the design process

> [!NOTE] Core flow
> - After each session, go and design something
> - Then come back and show them the design and get feedback again to ensure your design is aligned with the feedback you got
>	- They must trust that when they tell you things, you will implement them
>	- You can disagree and debate, but ultimately you must listen to them

# Social pressures
- Patients are scared to go against doctors because they feel the doctors must know better
- Nurses don't want to criticise in front of the manager that implemented a system

## Ground rules
Setting ground rules can alleviate social pressures 

- Agree that you're talking about a persona that has a problem
	- Avoids having to admit personal mistakes and risk recourse (E.G "I skipped safety checks because I was overworked and tired")

# Problems
- Many governments mandate the use of PD, leading to PD methods being used without following the philosophy of PD
	- Patients get ignored and systems they don't care for get deployed
