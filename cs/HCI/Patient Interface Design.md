# Overview
- Information sharing: difficult to design systems for this considering [[Ethical Concerns and Safety#Sensitive data|the regulations]], consent, and making it easy for doctors to access
- Patients will typically be older

# Trained vs untrained users
- Patients need simple interfaces that don't need training to use
- Professionals need nuanced, flexible software and can be trained
- Both groups will need completely different views on the same data

## Informal relationships
- There may be [[Informal Healthcare Systems|informal carers]] in the works that the system must design for too. They are also [[Stakeholders]]
- You must formalise these relationships during your design process

> [!NOTE] Systems
> Think of patients as an entire system of people. Example of a student with learning difficulties: the patient, their teachers, their parents, their support teacher

# Visual impairments
- Increasing font size
- Use highly-contrasting colours

# Motor limitations
- Make elements bigger
- Avoid [[Touchscreens|touch devices]] if possible
	- Tremors from Parkinson's disease make it harder to interact
	- They will often brace themselves against something - not a typical pose
	- They might struggle to hit the corners of screens

# Cognitive barriers
- Avoid medical jargon
- Minimise steps in instructions

> [!WARNING] What are cognitive challenges
> Not impaired intelligence, but rather it takes more effort to resolve intellectual challenges than people without these conditions.
> 
> Example: brain fog makes it take a long time to recall information, slowing time to understand something and making it tiring

# Hearing impairments
- Captions
- Use videos with people visibly speaking so that deaf users can lip-read

# Design guidelines
- Design for assistive technologies:
	- Subtitles
	- Screen readers
	- Voice recognition
- Follow the WCAG
	- Alt text for images (for screen readers)
- Regulatory standards:
	- UK: Equalities Act 2010 means you're responsible to comply with the WCAG
		- Not really enforced
	- USA: ADA
	- EU: Accessibility Act
