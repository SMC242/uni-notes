# Overview
[[Ethnography]] is a useful method for understanding how systems are used in reality

# Motivation
- Understanding how systems are used
	- The social context
	- Unanticipated use cases
- Understanding practices
	- Practices are the unit of ethnographic HCI (instead of interactions)
	- Practices are processes that occur at a particular time in a particular space
	- Cultures and values
- Used in multiple stages of the design process
	- Early: to gather requirements
	- Later: find out how the system is being used once it has been deployed in order to improve it

# Doing ethnography
- Don't assume your experience is universal
- Your study should be rooted in a particular context
	- The organisation
		- Its work practices
		- Values (of the company and of its members)
		- Interactions between people
	- A group of people

# Comparison to surveys
<ul class="breakdown">
	<li class="pro">Can ask deeper questions</li>
	<li class="pro">People don't give detailed answers to surveys (memory is poor, explaining is hard, they might not understand what they do, may lie)</li>
	<li class="pro">If in the early stages of the design process, you might not know what to ask</li>
	<li class="con">Surveys are cheaper</li>
	<li class="con">Requires many skills and resources (access to field, selecting the right questions and subjects, conversational skills, data analysis)</li>
	<li class="con">Expensive</li>
</ul>
