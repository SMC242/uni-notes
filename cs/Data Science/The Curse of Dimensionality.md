# Overview
As the number of dimensions in a vector increases, the data becomes so sparse that points become almost equi-distant. This is because there are so many ways a vector could be different from another that they are unlikely to be similar

Points concentrate towards the corners of the hypercube

If you put a sphere inside the hypercube, most points will be on the tiny areas of the intersections between the sphere and the cubes' surfaces. This is because the exterior region is larger than the interior region since there are so many cubes
