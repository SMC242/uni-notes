# Definition
- Contiguous blocks of memory used for storing homogeneous data
	- All elements must be of the same type
	- This means each element has the same size, which is crucial for allocating the correct amount of memory
- All rows must have the same number of columns
	- The shape is written like so: `ROWxCOLUMN` (E.G `3x2`)
	- An array that has an inconsistent number of columns is said to be "ragged"

# Libraries
## NumPy
- A Python library
- Provides fast array operations
- Built on top of FORTRAN
