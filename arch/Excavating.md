# Preserving sites
- Some areas are protected by national governments as they are important historical sites

# Developer-funded archaeology
- Before developing an area, developers might check that there's nothing important below it
- Test trenches are dug to see if there is anything underneath
- Commercial archaeologists are employed to oversee construction to watch for historical materials being uncovered

# Answering questions
- Often, sites aren't excavated until research aims are established
- Excavation usually doesn't occur for the sake of it. There has to be a question
- The aims determine the digging methods

# What are you looking for?
## Positive impacts
- When something has been added to the ground
- Walls, wells, steps

## Negative impacts
- Stuff removed from the ground
- Post holes, ditches, drainage

# Strategies
- Vertical strategies emphasise time
- Horizontal strategies focus on space
- The strategies chosen may change throughout a dig depending on new information, skills available, and the social context (E.G differing attitudes on how to respect the dead)
- Strategies are initially chosen based on what is expected to be found
- The area that has to be covered is important
	- If a motorway is being built, it's impossible to excavate the whole area
	- Instead, a pattern of test trenches may be dug

## Trenches
- Reveals [[arch/Context#Sequence|sequences]]
- Best for small teams

## Open areas
- Digging out a large area and digging down evenly across the whole space
- Great for finding spatial relations
	- Rich people may be located in certain parts of a settlement
- Takes a lot of effort
	- $1m^3$ is 1 tonne of soil
	- Lots of manpower and equipment required
- Loses the stratigraphy ([[arch/Context]])

## Box trenches
- Digging up squares
- These squares can be combined into an [[#Open areas|open area]]
- Squares can be added outwards to follow structures
