# Overview
- Applying the scientific method to archaology
- Relies on hypothesis testing
- Usually involves [[reconstruction]]s
	- Not all reconstructions are [[Experimental Archaeology]]
	- The key is the scientific method

# Recreating ships
Viking ships have been rebuild and sailed to find out:
- How they operated
- What it was like to be on them?
- The issues they had
- The skills required to use them (skill level)

# Hypothesis testing
![[Processual Archaeology]]

# Skill
- The amount of time required to learn a skill indicates the amount of free time people had
- If they could be practising something, then they weren't too busy farming
- If making a tool is difficult and the whole society runs on them, the people who made them would be very important
- Techniques can be noticed
	- This indicates different crafters

# Wear analysis
- Using a reconstructed tool on different materials and recording how it degrades
- Knowing how something degrades when used for a task allows you to go back to sites and work out what recovered tools were used for
- Different techniques may lead to different damages

## Burying
- Burying things to reveal how they erode
- Chalk degrades very quickly (over 10 years), then stabilises
- This revealed that certain earthworks today look similar to 10 years after they were built

# Simulation
- Building a structure and seeing how it wears over time
- Burning a structure to help understand sites

# Innovation
- On large projects, small improvements can save a large amount of time
- This means that improved tools make new things feasible

# Modern innovations
- Residue analysis can reveal how tools were used
- 3D modelling of reflective surfaces (previously impossible)

## Soil micromorphology
- Trampling on or applying treatments to soil to see how it's affected

# Issues
- Produces a range of possible results instead of a definitive result
- It can be difficult to repeat
- Some projects don't adhere well to the scientific method (E.G poor documentation of methods)
- Limited access to authentic resources
	- Often materials will be compromised on due to budget or knowledge constraints
	- Scope of projects is limited heavily by budgets
