# Destruction
- Excavation is a damaging process
- You may damage the structure if you aren't careful
	- It may collapse
	- It may be hit by tools
- Records are kept because you can only excavate once

# Post holes
- They may be broken and rebuild repeatedly, leading to confusion when digging it up
