# Satellite imaging
- Image resolution is important
	- The better the resolution, the clearer you can see the area
- Very important for modern archaeology because it allows you to remotely find sites
- May also be used to check that sites aren't being damaged

## Tell-focus
- Sites that are obvious from looking at them
- Big mounds are easy to spot
- Nomadic communities are a blind-spot because their sites are harder to find

# Aerial photography
- Images taken from a lower altitude
- Gives pictures with better resolutions
- Not free - you have to charter planes or borrow military pictures
- Wartime pictures are usually from before development, allowing archaeologists to find sites buried under modern towns
- The angle of the image reveals different things

## Shadow sites
Depressions in the earth can be spotted from their shadows. These are much easier to see from above

## Soilmark sites
Modern agriculture or landscaping sometimes reveals marks on the ground such as scattered stones

## Cropmark sites
Crop growth is affected by the earth below it. If there are buried walls underneath part of the field, the plants won't grow as well. This is a great tell

# LIDAR
- Using lasers to create maps of the topology
- Useful because it goes past vegetation
- Expensive, so often targeted

# Field survey
- People walk around the prospective site
- They take notes, sketches, and GPS points

## Fieldwalking
- Walking through *ploughed* fields, searching for artefacts

# Geophysical survey
- Doing tests on the soil to detect what's under the ground
- Often yields vague blobs that are then excavated

## Resistivity
- Sending electric currents through the soil to measure the resistance
- Ditches have lower resistance (higher water content)
- Stone has more resistance
- Effective for about 0.5 metres

## Magnetometry
- Looking at magnetic fields
- Fire sites (E.G fire pits) are very clear
- Can also be used for ditches and pits
- Faster than [[#Resistivity]] surveys
