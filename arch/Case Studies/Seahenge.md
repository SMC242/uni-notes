# Should it be protected?
- There was controversy about whether it should be excavated or allowed to be [[Destruction|destroyed]] by the tide
- Nobody was asked apart from English Heritage
- The site was very important for druids and pagans
- Is it fair for archaeologists and their organisations to control sites?

# Excavations
- The main trunk was sliced with a chainsaw
- Some of the surrounding timbers were uprooted

# Legacy

- Pro: it will be preserved
- Con: it has been removed from its context
